description: Development in RpgMaker and my experience revisiting an old project to make a full front to back demo.

```markdown
Exploration of the first demo I ever made in the game engine RPGMaker, vs revisiting the engine later on to refine it with a beginning and ending. Additionally, adding in new puzzles, enemies, items, and little suprises along the way.

## Embedded video of my demo with commentary

##### V1 of demo

With version one of the demo this was built out originally as a project for the UIUC Game Studies and Design minor. The purpose was to showcase building out cutscenes, puzzles, and design levels for a demo.

##### V2 of demo

I revisted the demo after a period of time to align many of the maps I had designed with a congruent story. Although short the demo is more unified and still showcases my ability to build out cutscenes, puzzles, events, and levels within a unified demo. Additionally, I added many smaller interactions to encourage exploration and to make many corners of maps feel worth exploring.
