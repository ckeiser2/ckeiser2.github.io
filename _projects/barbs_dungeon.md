Group project where over the span of a few weeks my group was tasked with designing a game. I was tasked with the main responsibilities of creating core systems to the game including *Player Experience, Level Design and Core Systems*. Also, while writing the narrative in which I was inspired by other RPGs such as *Fear and Hunger, Dark Souls, Dark and Darker*. | Below you will a see button that will take you to the google drive where my team and I collaborated on design documents including Proof of concepts, Tone Targets, Beat by Beat and more below!

## Vison Canvas: 
The *Vision Canvas* establishes amongst the development team what is our solidified vision of the game. Including outlining clearly what this game is, who is  it for and what are our core systems to create it. 

## Feature List: 
The *Feature List* helps the developers understand what are the core systems within the game. Additionally, focusing the team by ranking systems by their difficulty to both implement and design. Also, features risks around the system along with designer notes on other core aspects of the system.

## Asset List: 
The *Asset List* was created to communicate with artists and the rest of the team around what are the assets, models and animations would would need to develop the game. This allows for clear and concise communciation over what are the steps in development to achieve a working beta.
