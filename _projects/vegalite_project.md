# Python: Vega-lite

Interactive data visualization that showcases web pulled data of different car brands and their horsepower compared to their miles per gallon. The interactive component stems from being able to hover each circle to see a more detailed view of which car brand, horsepower, and miles per gallon in a window. As we can see many American cars on average have more horsepower but far worse miles per gallon compared to their Europe and Japan counterparts. Depending on the user of this data they may make their decision on a car based on their priorities by saving money with high miles per gallon or the utiliy of horsepower.

```python
from vega_datasets import data as datasets

source = datasets.cars()
source.rename(columns={"Miles_per_Gallon":"Miles per Gallon"}, inplace=True)
Turns out source is a data frame!
source
type(source)
import altair as alt

chart = alt.Chart(source).mark_circle(size=60).encode(
    x='Horsepower',
    y='Miles per Gallon',
    color='Origin',
    tooltip=['Name', 'Origin', 'Horsepower', 'Miles per Gallon']
).interactive()
chart

```
