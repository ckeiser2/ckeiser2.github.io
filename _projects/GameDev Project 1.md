*JavaScript* *:With // In-Engine Tools*


Short project for a class. Utilziing the RPGmaker engine, created a small demo with a variety of hard coded creature encounters and cutscenes. Attached is a recording of me breaking down how the encounters, abilities, and levels through a mediaspace video. Showcases core engineering concepts like end user appeal, technical knowledge and user first design.
