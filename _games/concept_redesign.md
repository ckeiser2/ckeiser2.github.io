# Goal of this project is to redesign Rivals of Aether II character Galvin! Specifically the characters main mechanic galvinazation!

For my character redesign I chose a character from a personal favorite game series of mine Rivals of Aether. This is a platform fighter that is heavily inspired by the fast paced combat seen in the Super Smash Bros. series. What is interesting in this game series is it's character designs as every character has an "aether" or elemental focus that they have dynamically integrated within their kits. These elements will range from the 4 major kingdoms in the game classicly fire, water, wind and earth. For the character we will be discussing Galvin is considered an earth related element with it's aether being metal/magnetism. 

What I have always considered is that a characters design should incorporate their narrative, thematic, and kit should all reinfornce one another synergistically. Galvin lore emphasizes a dinosaur-esque creature revived into a modern aether world. Enhanced with augments in this Frankenstein-esque fantasy, Galvin wreaks havoc on the variety of aether stages. The key mechanic with Galvin is his ability to enter a "Galvinized" state where the rust covering it's metal body falls off enhancing his charge/strong and special attacks. I will outline below the conditions that need to happen in order to both gain this "Galivinized" state and lose it.

##### Standard model without galvinized mechanic

Gaining Galvinzization:
- Hit a basic physical atttack

Losing Galvinsization:
- Get hit by any attack
- Use a special or charge/strong attack (As it was enhanced by the state)
- Get parried
- Lose a stock (What platform fighting games will call lifes)

##### Model change when galvinized
