The kitchen was spick and\\nspan: the cook said you could see yourself in the big copper boilers. The fire\\nwas nice and bright and on one of the side-tables were four very big\\nbarmbracks. These barmbracks seemed uncut; but if you went closer you would see\\nthat they had been cut into long thick even slices and were ready to be handed\\nround at tea. Maria had cut them herself.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nMaria was a very, very small person indeed but she had a very long nose and a\\nvery long chin. She talked a little through her nose, always soothingly:\\n<i>&ldquo;Yes, my dear,&rdquo;</i> and <i>&ldquo;No, my dear.&rdquo;</i> She\\nwas always sent for when the women quarrelled over their tubs and always\\nsucceeded in making peace. One day the matron had said to her:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\n&ldquo;Maria, you are a veritable peace-maker!&rdquo;\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nAnd the sub-matron and two of the Board ladies had heard the compliment. And\\nGinger Mooney was always saying what she wouldn&rsquo;t do to the dummy who had\\ncharge of the irons if it wasn&rsquo;t for Maria. Everyone was so fond of\\nMaria.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nThe women would have their tea at six o&rsquo;clock and she would be able to\\nget away before seven. From Ballsbridge to the Pillar, twenty minutes; from the\\nPillar to Drumcondra, twenty minutes; and twenty minutes to buy the things. She\\nwould be there before eight. She took out her purse with the silver clasps and\\nread again the words <i>A Present from Belfast</i>. She was very fond of that\\npurse because Joe had brought it to her five years before when he and Alphy had\\ngone to Belfast on a Whit-Monday trip. In the purse were two half-crowns and\\nsome coppers. She would have five shillings clear after paying tram fare. What\\na nice evening they would have, all the children singing! Only she hoped that\\nJoe wouldn&rsquo;t come in drunk. He was so different when he took any drink.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nOften he had wanted her to go and live with them; but she would have felt\\nherself in the way (though Joe&rsquo;s wife was ever so nice with her) and she\\nhad become accustomed to the life of the laundry. Joe was a good fellow. She\\nhad nursed him and Alphy too; and Joe used often say:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\n&ldquo;Mamma is mamma but Maria is my proper mother.&rdquo;\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nAfter the break-up at home the boys had got her that position in the <i>Dublin\\nby Lamplight</i> laundry, and she liked it. She used to have such a bad opinion\\nof Protestants but now she thought they were very nice people, a little quiet\\nand serious, but still very nice people to live with. Then she had her plants\\nin the conservatory and she liked looking after them. She had lovely ferns and\\nwax-plants and, whenever anyone came to visit her, she always gave the visitor\\none or two slips from her conservatory. There was one thing she didn&rsquo;t\\nlike and that was the tracts on the walks; but the matron was such a nice\\nperson to deal with, so genteel.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nWhen the cook told her everything was ready she went into the women&rsquo;s\\nroom and began to pull the big bell. In a few minutes the women began to come\\nin by twos and threes, wiping their steaming hands in their petticoats and\\npulling down the sleeves of their blouses over their red steaming arms. They\\nsettled down before their huge mugs which the cook and the dummy filled up with\\nhot tea, already mixed with milk and sugar in huge tin cans. Maria\\nsuperintended the distribution of the barmbrack and saw that every woman got\\nher four slices. There was a great deal of laughing and joking during the meal.\\nLizzie Fleming said Maria was sure to get the ring and, though Fleming had said\\nthat for so many Hallow Eves, Maria had to laugh and say she didn&rsquo;t want\\nany ring or man either; and when she laughed her grey-green eyes sparkled with\\ndisappointed shyness and the tip of her nose nearly met the tip of her chin.\\nThen Ginger Mooney lifted up her mug of tea and proposed Maria&rsquo;s health\\nwhile all the other women clattered with their mugs on the table, and said she\\nwas sorry she hadn&rsquo;t a sup of porter to drink it in. And Maria laughed\\nagain till the tip of her nose nearly met the tip of her chin and till her\\nminute body nearly shook itself asunder because she knew that Mooney meant well\\nthough, of course, she had the notions of a common woman.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nBut wasn&rsquo;t Maria glad when the women had finished their tea and the cook\\nand the dummy had begun to clear away the tea-things! She went into her little\\nbedroom and, remembering that the next morning was a mass morning, changed the\\nhand of the alarm from seven to six. Then she took off her working skirt and\\nher house-boots and laid her best skirt out on the bed and her tiny dress-boots\\nbeside the foot of the bed. She changed her blouse too and, as she stood before\\nthe mirror, she thought of how she used to dress for mass on Sunday morning\\nwhen she was a young girl; and she looked with quaint affection at the\\ndiminutive body which she had so often adorned. In spite of its years she found\\nit a nice tidy little body.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nWhen she got outside the streets were shining with rain and she was glad of her\\nold brown waterproof. The tram was full and she had to sit on the little stool\\nat the end of the car, facing all the people, with her toes barely touching the\\nfloor. She arranged in her mind all she was going to do and thought how much\\nbetter it was to be independent and to have your own money in your pocket. She\\nhoped they would have a nice evening. She was sure they would but she could not\\nhelp thinking what a pity it was Alphy and Joe were not speaking. They were\\nalways falling out now but when they were boys together they used to be the\\nbest of friends: but such was life.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nShe got out of her tram at the Pillar and ferreted her way quickly among the\\ncrowds. She went into Downes&rsquo;s cake-shop but the shop was so full of\\npeople that it was a long time before she could get herself attended to. She\\nbought a dozen of mixed penny cakes, and at last came out of the shop laden\\nwith a big bag. Then she thought what else would she buy: she wanted to buy\\nsomething really nice. They would be sure to have plenty of apples and nuts. It\\nwas hard to know what to buy and all she could think of was cake. She decided\\nto buy some plumcake but Downes&rsquo;s plumcake had not enough almond icing on\\ntop of it so she went over to a shop in Henry Street. Here she was a long time\\nin suiting herself and the stylish young lady behind the counter, who was\\nevidently a little annoyed by her, asked her was it wedding-cake she wanted to\\nbuy. That made Maria blush and smile at the young lady; but the young lady took\\nit all very seriously and finally cut a thick slice of plumcake, parcelled it\\nup and said:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\n&ldquo;Two-and-four, please.&rdquo;\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nShe thought she would have to stand in the Drumcondra tram because none of the\\nyoung men seemed to notice her but an elderly gentleman made room for her. He\\nwas a stout gentleman and he wore a brown hard hat; he had a square red face\\nand a greyish moustache. Maria thought he was a colonel-looking gentleman and\\nshe reflected how much more polite he was than the young men who simply stared\\nstraight before them. The gentleman began to chat with her about Hallow Eve and\\nthe rainy weather. He supposed the bag was full of good things for the little\\nones and said it was only right that the youngsters should enjoy themselves\\nwhile they were young. Maria agreed with him and favoured him with demure nods\\nand hems. He was very nice with her, and when she was getting out at the Canal\\nBridge she thanked him and bowed, and he bowed to her and raised his hat and\\nsmiled agreeably, and while she was going up along the terrace, bending her\\ntiny head under the rain, she thought how easy it was to know a gentleman even\\nwhen he has a drop taken.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nEverybody said: <i>&ldquo;O, here&rsquo;s Maria!&rdquo;</i> when she came to\\nJoe&rsquo;s house. Joe was there, having come home from business, and all the\\nchildren had their Sunday dresses on. There were two big girls in from next\\ndoor and games were going on. Maria gave the bag of cakes to the eldest boy,\\nAlphy, to divide and Mrs Donnelly said it was too good of her to bring such a\\nbig bag of cakes and made all the children say:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\n&ldquo;Thanks, Maria.&rdquo;\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nBut Maria said she had brought something special for papa and mamma, something\\nthey would be sure to like, and she began to look for her plumcake. She tried\\nin Downes&rsquo;s bag and then in the pockets of her waterproof and then on the\\nhallstand but nowhere could she find it. Then she asked all the children had\\nany of them eaten it&mdash;by mistake, of course&mdash;but the children all\\nsaid no and looked as if they did not like to eat cakes if they were to be\\naccused of stealing. Everybody had a solution for the mystery and Mrs Donnelly\\nsaid it was plain that Maria had left it behind her in the tram. Maria,\\nremembering how confused the gentleman with the greyish moustache had made her,\\ncoloured with shame and vexation and disappointment. At the thought of the\\nfailure of her little surprise and of the two and fourpence she had thrown away\\nfor nothing she nearly cried outright.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nBut Joe said it didn&rsquo;t matter and made her sit down by the fire. He was\\nvery nice with her. He told her all that went on in his office, repeating for\\nher a smart answer which he had made to the manager. Maria did not understand\\nwhy Joe laughed so much over the answer he had made but she said that the\\nmanager must have been a very overbearing person to deal with. Joe said he\\nwasn&rsquo;t so bad when you knew how to take him, that he was a decent sort so\\nlong as you didn&rsquo;t rub him the wrong way. Mrs Donnelly played the piano\\nfor the children and they danced and sang. Then the two next-door girls handed\\nround the nuts. Nobody could find the nutcrackers and Joe was nearly getting\\ncross over it and asked how did they expect Maria to crack nuts without a\\nnutcracker. But Maria said she didn&rsquo;t like nuts and that they\\nweren&rsquo;t to bother about her. Then Joe asked would she take a bottle of\\nstout and Mrs Donnelly said there was port wine too in the house if she would\\nprefer that. Maria said she would rather they didn&rsquo;t ask her to take\\nanything: but Joe insisted.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nSo Maria let him have his way and they sat by the fire talking over old times\\nand Maria thought she would put in a good word for Alphy. But Joe cried that\\nGod might strike him stone dead if ever he spoke a word to his brother again\\nand Maria said she was sorry she had mentioned the matter. Mrs Donnelly told\\nher husband it was a great shame for him to speak that way of his own flesh and\\nblood but Joe said that Alphy was no brother of his and there was nearly being\\na row on the head of it. But Joe said he would not lose his temper on account\\nof the night it was and asked his wife to open some more stout. The two\\nnext-door girls had arranged some Hallow Eve games and soon everything was\\nmerry again. Maria was delighted to see the children so merry and Joe and his\\nwife in such good spirits. The next-door girls put some saucers on the table\\nand then led the children up to the table, blindfold. One got the prayer-book\\nand the other three got the water; and when one of the next-door girls got the\\nring Mrs Donnelly shook her finger at the blushing girl as much as to say:\\n<i>O, I know all about it!</i> They insisted then on blindfolding Maria and\\nleading her up to the table to see what she would get; and, while they were\\nputting on the bandage, Maria laughed and laughed again till the tip of her\\nnose nearly met the tip of her chin.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nThey led her up to the table amid laughing and joking and she put her hand out\\nin the air as she was told to do. She moved her hand about here and there in\\nthe air and descended on one of the saucers. She felt a soft wet substance with\\nher fingers and was surprised that nobody spoke or took off her bandage. There\\nwas a pause for a few seconds; and then a great deal of scuffling and\\nwhispering. Somebody said something about the garden, and at last Mrs Donnelly\\nsaid something very cross to one of the next-door girls and told her to throw\\nit out at once: that was no play. Maria understood that it was wrong that time\\nand so she had to do it over again: and this time she got the prayer-book.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nAfter that Mrs Donnelly played Miss McCloud&rsquo;s Reel for the children and\\nJoe made Maria take a glass of wine. Soon they were all quite merry again and\\nMrs Donnelly said Maria would enter a convent before the year was out because\\nshe had got the prayer-book. Maria had never seen Joe so nice to her as he was\\nthat night, so full of pleasant talk and reminiscences. She said they were all\\nvery good to her.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nAt last the children grew tired and sleepy and Joe asked Maria would she not\\nsing some little song before she went, one of the old songs. Mrs Donnelly said\\n<i>&ldquo;Do, please, Maria!&rdquo;</i> and so Maria had to get up and stand\\nbeside the piano. Mrs Donnelly bade the children be quiet and listen to\\nMaria&rsquo;s song. Then she played the prelude and said <i>&ldquo;Now,\\nMaria!&rdquo;</i> and Maria, blushing very much began to sing in a tiny\\nquavering voice. She sang <i>I Dreamt that I Dwelt</i>, and when she came to\\nthe second verse she sang again:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p class=\"poem\">\\n<i>I dreamt that I dwelt in marble halls<br />\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0With vassals and serfs at my side<br />\\nAnd of all who assembled within those walls<br />\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0That I was the hope and the pride.<br />\\nI had riches too great to count, could boast<br />\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Of a high ancestral name,<br />\\nBut I also dreamt, which pleased me most,<br />\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0That you loved me still the same.</i>\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nBut no one tried to show her her mistake; and when she had ended her song Joe\\nwas very much moved. He said that there was no time like the long ago and no\\nmusic for him like poor old Balfe, whatever other people might say; and his\\neyes filled up so much with tears that he could not find what he was looking\\nfor and in the end he had to ask his wife to tell him where the corkscrew was.\\n</p>\\n\\n</div><!--end chapter-->\\n\\n</body>\\n</html>\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

Then she asked all the children had\\nany of them eaten it&#8212;by mistake, of course&#8212;but the children all\\nsaid no and looked as if they did not like to eat cakes if they were to be\\naccused of stealing. Everybody had a solution for the mystery and Mrs Donnelly\\nsaid it was plain that Maria had left it behind her in the tram. Maria,\\nremembering how confused the gentleman with the greyish moustache had made her,\\ncoloured with shame and vexation and disappointment. At the thought of the\\nfailure of her little surprise and of the two and fourpence she had thrown away\\nfor nothing she nearly cried outright.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nBut Joe said it didn&#8217;t matter and made her sit down by the fire. He was\\nvery nice with her. He told her all that went on in his office, repeating for\\nher a smart answer which he had made to the manager. Maria did not understand\\nwhy Joe laughed so much over the answer he had made but she said that the\\nmanager must have been a very overbearing person to deal with. Joe said he\\nwasn&#8217;t so bad when you knew how to take him, that he was a decent sort so\\nlong as you didn&#8217;t rub him the wrong way. Mrs Donnelly played the piano\\nfor the children and they danced and sang. Then the two next-door girls handed\\nround the nuts. Nobody could find the nutcrackers and Joe was nearly getting\\ncross over it and asked how did they expect Maria to crack nuts without a\\nnutcracker. But Maria said she didn&#8217;t like nuts and that they\\nweren&#8217;t to bother about her. Then Joe asked would she take a bottle of\\nstout and Mrs Donnelly said there was port wine too in the house if she would\\nprefer that. Maria said she would rather they didn&#8217;t ask her to take\\nanything: but Joe insisted.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nSo Maria let him have his way and they sat by the fire talking over old times\\nand Maria thought she would put in a good word for Alphy. But Joe cried that\\nGod might strike him stone dead if ever he spoke a word to his brother again\\nand Maria said she was sorry she had mentioned the matter. Mrs Donnelly told\\nher husband it was a great shame for him to speak that way of his own flesh and\\nblood but Joe said that Alphy was no brother of his and there was nearly being\\na row on the head of it. But Joe said he would not lose his temper on account\\nof the night it was and asked his wife to open some more stout. The two\\nnext-door girls had arranged some Hallow Eve games and soon everything was\\nmerry again. Maria was delighted to see the children so merry and Joe and his\\nwife in such good spirits. The next-door girls put some saucers on the table\\nand then led the children up to the table, blindfold. One got the prayer-book\\nand the other three got the water; and when one of the next-door girls got the\\nring Mrs Donnelly shook her finger at the blushing girl as much as to say:\\n<i>O, I know all about it!</i> They insisted then on blindfolding Maria and\\nleading her up to the table to see what she would get; and, while they were\\nputting on the bandage, Maria laughed and laughed again till the tip of her\\nnose nearly met the tip of her chin.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nThey led her up to the table amid laughing and joking and she put her hand out\\nin the air as she was told to do. She moved her hand about here and there in\\nthe air and descended on one of the saucers. She felt a soft wet substance with\\nher fingers and was surprised that nobody spoke or took off her bandage. There\\nwas a pause for a few seconds; and then a great deal of scuffling and\\nwhispering. Somebody said something about the garden, and at last Mrs Donnelly\\nsaid something very cross to one of the next-door girls and told her to throw\\nit out at once: that was no play. Maria understood that it was wrong that time\\nand so she had to do it over again: and this time she got the prayer-book.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nAfter that Mrs Donnelly played Miss McCloud&#8217;s Reel for the children and\\nJoe made Maria take a glass of wine. Soon they were all quite merry again and\\nMrs Donnelly said Maria would enter a convent before the year was out because\\nshe had got the prayer-book. Maria had never seen Joe so nice to her as he was\\nthat night, so full of pleasant talk and reminiscences. She said they were all\\nvery good to her.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nAt last the children grew tired and sleepy and Joe asked Maria would she not\\nsing some little song before she went, one of the old songs. Mrs Donnelly said\\n<i>&#8220;Do, please, Maria!&#8221;</i> and so Maria had to get up and stand\\nbeside the piano. Mrs Donnelly bade the children be quiet and listen to\\nMaria&#8217;s song. Then she played the prelude and said <i>&#8220;Now,\\nMaria!&#8221;</i> and Maria, blushing very much began to sing in a tiny\\nquavering voice. She sang <i>I Dreamt that I Dwelt</i>, and when she came to\\nthe second verse she sang again:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p class=\"poem\">\\n<i>I dreamt that I dwelt in marble halls<br />\\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With vassals and serfs at my side<br />\\nAnd of all who assembled within those walls<br />\\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That I was the hope and the pride.<br />\\nI had riches too great to count, could boast<br />\\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of a high ancestral name,<br />\\nBut I also dreamt, which pleased me most,<br />\\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That you loved me still the same.</i>\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nBut no one tried to show her her mistake; and when she had ended her song Joe\\nwas very much moved.
