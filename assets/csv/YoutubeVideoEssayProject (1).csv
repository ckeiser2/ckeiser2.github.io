David Lynch: The Treachery of Language,"275,647","14,000",3/30/18,11:10,"0:00
[Interviewer] “David Lynch has described his film Eraserhead in this manner...""
0:06
""A dream of dark and troubling things.""
0:10
""And... uh...""
0:12
""Would you like to expound on that a little?”
0:14
[David Lynch] “No.”
0:16
David Lynch is famous for his reluctance to verbally explain or clarify the intentions
0:21
behind his work. It’s a tendency exhibited as early as this student led interview in 1979,
0:27
and it’s repeatedly reflected in what Lynch does say, that:
0:31
“As soon as you put things in words, no one ever sees the film the same way.""
0:34
""And that’s what I hate, you know.""
0:37
""Talking—it’s real dangerous.”
0:39
And this troubled relationship with words extends to the work itself. From the backwards
0:44
riddles of The Man from Another Place to the hearing loss of Lynch’s own Twin Peaks character, Gordon Cole.
0:49
[Gordon Cole] “You’ll have to speak up Sheriff. Hearings gone, long story.”
0:53
In his book ‘The Man From Another Place’, film writer Dennis Lim writes of Gordon’s
0:57
character that, “so much about Lynch’s fraught relationship with language is summed
1:01
up in that voice, in its unnervingly high volume and halting cadences.”
1:06
This ‘fraught relationship’ with language repeatedly appears as a need to twist, invert
1:11
and disrupt it, and seems indicative of an underlying fear or, perhaps more accurately,
1:17
a mistrust of the spoken or written word, and its power.
1:21
The art image or object and written language have historically been thought of as hostile
1:26
concepts, with artist Robert Morris once writing in his dream journal that “the wall label
1:31
disturbed my sleep.
1:33
It grew to threatening proportions, entwined itself around me, babbled in my ear,
1:38
wrapped itself over my eyes.
1:40
It was a tangled, suffocating shroud of seething words in my dream”.
1:45
And this nightmarish description of the wall text, the written explanation that would accompany
1:49
his work, finds a visual companion in one of Lynch’s earliest short films ‘The Alphabet’,
1:54
where a child is tormented by the incessant chanting of the alphabet that invades their dreams.
2:00
But, more than a suffocating shroud, the letters here emerge violently, secreted onto the screen
2:06
through ruptured openings.
2:07
The letters creep and spread like an infection before entering the head of a human figure,
2:12
causing it to bleed and disintegrate.
2:15
But, rather than the letters themselves necessarily invoking this anguish, it’s their ceremonial
2:20
delivery that transforms them into something menacing.
2:24
The threatening chant like an anthem of conformity, a structural order mirrored in the scales
2:30
and arpeggios of the vocals that follow, as well as in the very arrangement of the alphabet,
2:35
repeatedly presented in its familiar linear form.
2:38
It’s these formal structures that shape the anxiety behind the film, suggesting that
2:43
there’s something dangerous and violent in the act of learning, in the formation of
2:47
language, in binding expression with words.
2:51
According to Lynch, language “changes things, as soon as you know what something is.”
2:56
[David Lynch] “If you don't know what it is, a sore can be very beautiful...""
3:03
""... but as soon as you name it, it stops being beautiful to most people...""
3:10
""… but if you took a picture of it, a close up, and you didn’t know exactly what it was...""
3:15
""... it could be a great beauty of organic phenomenon.”
3:19
So, this uneasiness surrounding words is really to do with the limitations they suddenly enforce
3:26
when used as a tool of translation, to translate an image, a feeling or thought into a language
3:32
that doesn’t quite allow for the same nuance or abstraction – to take something suggestive
3:37
and reduce it to something definitive.
3:40
But this apprehension towards words doesn’t necessarily require a rejection of them, or
3:45
even a reluctance to use them.
3:48
Lynch may remain ambiguous when discussing interpretation but has frequently spoken about
3:52
his creative process and formative experiences, and, in addition to the parade of letters
3:57
in ‘The Alphabet’, the written and spoken word remain central to the work.
4:01
The words of Lynch’s film and television work emerge as memorably enigmatic phrases
4:06
that only pose more questions than they could ever answer.
4:18
Commenting on the speech patterns of Lynch’s dialogue, Dennis Lim determined that:
4:22
""the impression is of language used less for meaning than for sound.
4:25
To savour the thingness of words is to move away from their imprisoning nature”.
4:30
This impression of words as somewhat divorced from linguistic intent is a technique that
4:35
resurfaces throughout Lynch’s image-making.
4:38
These works inscribe a naively worded description onto the surface of the image, titles that
4:43
are reminiscent of the art history tradition where works are simply named after their subject
4:47
matter such as ‘Still Life with a Swan’ or ‘Self Portrait with Sunflower’.
4:52
But these descriptions, while accurate to the image, complicate the work as much as
4:56
they explain it – with absurd or violent imagery communicated with direct simplicity.
5:02
And so, instead of merely acting as translation, the title transcends the limitations of the
5:07
label in becoming complicit in the ambiguity, stripping the words of their definitive power.
5:12
Lynch’s work repeatedly draws attention to this relationship between words and the
5:16
objects they describe, always with the intent of disrupting it and taking control of it.
5:21
In his Ricky Board series, the transformative power of naming is both exposed and manipulated,
5:28
exploring how identical objects, such as flies or bees, can change when given different names.
5:33
Lynch has detailed the instructions to this process, ending with a poem that explains:
5:38
Even though they’re all the same The change comes from the name
5:42
As well as demonstrating how words can alter or contaminate our understanding of an object,
5:47
in a way, this also challenges the presupposed unity of a thing and its name.
5:52
Instead of reading the name as a direct and uncompromised translation of the thing it
5:57
describes, these works indicate a more uncertain relationship.
6:01
In his catalogue essay for the exhibition David Lynch: Naming, curator Brett Littman comments that:
6:07
“… the act of naming something is never a simple gesture.""
6:10
""For Lynch, the drawing of an 'ant' and the written word 'ant' are never co-equal or necessarily co-descriptive.”
6:17
One can’t be considered a direct translation of the other.
6:21
Similarly, this uncertainty between word and object is paralleled in the interruption often
6:26
found between voice and body in Lynch’s moving image work.
6:29
In the silent advice of the log in Twin Peaks,
6:32
the distorted voice over the intercom in Lost Highway, or the repeated use of lip-synching
6:37
and miming in Blue Velvet and Mullholland Drive, once again suggesting an uncertain
6:42
relationship between word and body in creating, not only a separation of space but equally
6:48
of time in the supposed live performance of a pre-recorded voice.
6:52
It’s this final mime in Mulholland Drive, a Spanish acapella cover of Roy Orbison’s
6:57
‘Crying’ that deals most intensely with the modes of translation implicit in this separation:
7:02
pre-recorded performance to live, original song to cover and the original English language to Spanish.
7:10
And this idea of translation is one that I keep returning to when talking about the written
7:15
and spoken word in Lynch’s work – the danger of translating an image to writing,
7:20
the desire to undermine the written word’s definitive power and to emphasise acts of
7:24
translation that aren’t always so readily apparent.
7:29
As Pedro Carolino once mistranslated: It is difficult to enjoy well so much several languages.
7:37
This is the final remark in a hypothetical exchange in his phrasebook 'English as She is Spoke',
7:42
well known for, as both that line and the title might suggest, the unintentional
7:47
humour of its mistranslation of Portuguese phrases to English,
7:51
but it’s the mistranslation that inadvertently proves the truth in this line.
7:55
Conveying the meaning of one language in another is difficult,
7:59
perhaps, according to Lynch’s work, even impossible.
8:03
Obviously we’re not talking here about the literal translation of one spoken language
8:07
to another, but of the reconfiguration of meaning as it travels from one state to another,
8:12
from thought to description, feeling to image, image to word, and also from one person to another.
8:20
The artist Allison Katz writes in her essay ‘What is at Hand?’, “I know a dance
8:24
critic who learnt how to write her reviews by taking courses in literary translation.
8:29
To move between French and English for example is, in her mind, the same as moving from seeing
8:34
a dance performance to writing about it”.
8:37
I think this comparison deftly reveals the hidden translations with which we all regularly
8:41
engage but that so often go unnoticed, and Lynch’s approach to the written and spoken
8:46
word seems to mourn what is lost in this process.
8:50
His early ‘kit’ series, particularly ‘Fish Kit’ from 1979 takes this idea of re-assembling
8:55
something as a process incapable of producing that thing in its original pre-disassembled state.
9:02
Three assembled parts of a dead fish will not reproduce the live fish it once was.
9:06
And, in a way, this is a pretty apt metaphor for interpretation or, perhaps even, all communication.
9:13
We might receive signals, but there’s a distance there, between one person and another
9:19
between meaning and interpretation
9:22
between what is said and what we understand.
9:25
I chose to include this example from Carolino’s phrase book, not just for its irony, but also
9:30
because of how this interaction is titled: ‘to inform oneself of a person’.
9:35
It’s an unintentionally appropriate introduction to the nature of language and why Lynch might
9:40
be so wary of it, fundamentally linking language and translation to the act of knowing another
9:46
person, a relationship that necessitates the invisible disassembling and reassembling of
9:52
meaning and intent, even if we think we’re speaking the same language.
9:56
But even though with each translation something is undoubtedly lost, with each translator,
10:02
each viewer, something is also gained.
10:05
Just as the Ricky Board flies change with their name, it’s this negotiation that prevents
10:10
an idea from ever being reduced to something definitive.
10:13
Rather than rejecting written or spoken language, running from it,
10:18
Lynch uses words to make us aware of their shortcomings,
10:21
refuting their authority, making them uncertain,
10:25
but still, never underestimating the power of silence.
10:30
[Blue Haired Woman] “Silencio.”
10:42
Hey everyone, this was actually supposed to be my one year anniversary video but it’s,
10:47
um, 2 months late.
10:50
but I’m still counting this as an anniversary video because my first video was
10:54
on David Lynch so it seems fitting.
10:57
I don’t know if I’ll make any more videos on David Lynch as I think the world is probably
11:00
at capacity on David Lynch videos.
11:03
but thank you for choosing to watch this one, and I hope I’ll see you next time.

[Interviewer] “David Lynch has described his film Eraserhead in this manner...""
0:06

1:36
Today on Serious Lore Analysis, we're covering a creative work that I heavily implied might have been coming next in the last few videos!
1:44
And that's right, today we're covering... the CTRL+ALT+DEL webcomic & animated series.
1:49
In retrospect, I think I might have made it too obvious. For those of you too young to remember the early days of the world,
1:56
before we had the internet and hadn't yet achieved the dream of having to argue with Holocaust deniers all day,
2:01
humans would amuse themselves by painting stuff on the walls of their caves, or later, drawing it onto paper or canvas.
2:07
These scribbles became known as [PAINFULLY ELONGATED] ""aaaaaaaaaarrrrrrt.""
2:13
Eventually, however, humans evolved past this bullshit and realized you could divide up your space into smaller sub-spaces, called
2:20
""pah-nells"", and then use that to create several sequential images which, when read in order, could tell a story.
2:26
This ""sequence art"" later became known as ""comics"", for reasons we forgot because it doesn't matter.
2:32
Fast forward to the late 90s and early 2000s, where we played video games and things were finally good.
2:37
Then, people who enjoyed video games gained access to the internet. But because they didn't yet have the bandwidth to play most games online
2:44
or watch puppy compilations all day and argue in the comments about 9/11, people instead would amuse themselves online by using ""webcomics"",
2:51
also known as digital versions of comics that you find on the web. And since the bar for publishing onto the internet was as low as being able to afford server hosting,
3:00
or even lower if you used a free website, people were finally free to create comics for as small or niche an audience as they liked
3:06
without any need for mass market appeal, or the production costs of ink and paper and printing,
3:12
or, um... quality. Enter the gaming webcomic, a form of webcomic centering around jokes about games and gaming culture.
3:20
The most popular of these was Penny Arcade, a comic still going to this day, rife with hilarious and well thought out humour.
3:27
""Don't stake me bro""? Ha ha ha, hilarious! It's just like the thing! With the guy!
3:36
The bedrock of this type of comic tends to feature several characters, often representative of the authors, sitting on a couch making hilarious jokes about video games that are out right now,
3:44
or inside the fiction of a video game, interacting with it to hilarious consequences. These two forms were the bedrock of many early gaming webcomics from the late 90s to the early 2000s,
3:54
and there were many successful comics using this format, like Penny Arcade, PvP, Little Gamers, Bob and George, 8-Bit Theater, and others.
4:02
All tremendous pieces of art with a lot to say about games and how bad it is that our games are being usurped by money men,
4:08
and how funny it would be if you died... in a way a lot bi— uh, like— it's just like in the game!
4:14
But for every one of these comics, there were dozens of poor imitators out to replicate their popularity and profit by reusing the same tropes.
4:22
An explosion in the gaming webcomic had begun, and it would continue for over a decade.
4:27
Enter Tim Buckley with his own webcomic, CTRL+ALT+DEL, often referred to as CAD. CAD isn't like the other webcomics. It's not art. It doesn't have value or meaning.
4:37
It's trash, and it doesn't say anything at all. It's full of worthless jokes where the punchline is violence.
4:43
It's not like Penny Arcade. CAD is the ""story"" of Ethan, a character who looks suspiciously like how Buckley draws himself.
4:50
Ethan and his roommate Lucas talk about video games, and occasionally are inside the games, where something bad happens to them or people they don't like.
4:57
Wow, that's original. Let's compare and contrast this with a good comic, shall we? In this 2002 page from Penny Arcade, the author insert characters burn a voodoo doll, hurting George Romero.
5:07
Oh my God, look how much better these guys are. This is great! Meanwhile, look over here at CAD in the slow lane for idiots.
5:14
Using violence as a punchline? What a stupid thing to put in a comic! Over time, CAD stopped even trying to tell jokes, and it started spending more and more time
5:23
exploring the personal lives and development of its characters. The main characters Ethan & Lucas went on dates, moved apartments, made and lost friends, and started long-term relationships.
5:33
Ethan quickly meets and begins dating Lilah, a girl who plays video games, which, as we all know, is like finding a unicorn.
5:39
And, like all girls who do play games, it's her only character trait. The two inexplicably fall in love, even though Ethan has nothing to offer anyone and is basically unlikable.
5:47
It's pretty clear from reading this that Buckley doesn't know how human relationships work. You could almost point out that this... almost says something
5:56
about how people who play video games a lot view human relationships, but...
6:06
N-No, no, no, no, it's bad, and it doesn't mean anything. Tim Buckley's just really bad at making comics.
6:13
Oh, also, despite being basically unable to do anything but play video games, Ethan eventually builds a sentient AI robot who becomes the fourth main character.
6:22
Zeke exists to occasionally joke about how humans are made of meat and bad, and he's better than them.
6:27
It's clearly inspired by characters like HK-47 from KOTOR or Bender from Futurama, but there's no actual jokes here.
6:33
It's what I like to call a joke by association. It's not really a joke, it's just a vague gesture in the direction of a joke that you might remember from somewhere else.
6:45
Somewhere else... I'm s— I'm somewhere— somewhere else...? I...
6:52
(static)
7:01
(panting) Why are you doing this? Don't do this to yourself.
7:08
Don't become one of them. One of what?
7:14
(breathes heavily) (groans) The worst thing about this comic is that it doesn't know what it wants to be.
7:23
No, wait. Actually, the worst thing is CAD Premium. For a few years, you could pay a monthly fee to get access to episodes of the CAD animated series,
7:32
which the comic inexplicably had. It ran for two seasons, and some episodes ran up to 6 minutes.
7:39
If you thought a story featuring cartoon violence, a futuristic killer robot, video game opinions on a couch,
7:45
and awkward boring serious relationship drama had trouble finding its identity in comic form,
7:51
just wait until it comes in a box set containing barely two hours of animation made in about a week that you paid thirty-five entire dollars of your actual human money for!
8:00
Three episodes of the 12-episode first season are dedicated entirely to an extended Star Wars reference.
8:07
They reenact an entire Star Wars film in each five-minute episode, compressing it down so much you'd barely even realize that's what they're doing
8:14
unless you listen to the director's commentary track, which this show has, for some reason!
8:19
The villain, instead of Darth Vader, is Jack Thompson, a lawyer who tried to sue game developers for making their players violent.
8:26
The Death Star is a sign that makes people stop playing video games...? ""It's time to test the power of this fully operational anti-gamer billboard.""
8:36
Speaking of Jack Thompson, Thompson appeared to have struck a nerve with Buckley. One page of the comic is straight-up an open letter to Jack,
8:43
a four panel long mini-novel spoken directly by Buckley himself from within the comic.
8:49
What's amazing about it is how it manages to, while claiming gamers are peaceful even though they've played a lot of violent games,
8:55
end with the threatening phrase, ""don't fuck with us."" Which, by the way, is also a line from that scene in Fight Club
9:02
where they threaten to cut off a guy's testicles if he defies them.
9:08
""Do not fuck with us."" Imagine writing something like that and thinking, ""Yeah!
9:15
That proves that gamers are peaceful and intelligent, and can be reasoned with!""
9:20
It almost says something about gamers when people sit down and write things like— (static)
9:27
Where's that fucking noise coming from?! Where's— [EERIE DISTORTION]
9:42
[DISTORTION GROWS LOUDER] Don't you think you might be reading a little too much into it?
9:49
About what a bad comic that sucks might ""say""? Stick to thinking about real art.
9:55
Ugh, this is just like that Sonic thing, isn't it? What... the Sonic thing?
10:02
You're overthinking a blue hedgehog, man. Why can't you be objective? Why can't you talk about the level design and mechanics instead?
10:09
You could be talking about how Mario 1-1 teaches you how to play it. But it's not just a hedgehog, is it? I mean, it's animals, fighting a developed machine empire.
10:19
Like, there's— There's very, very obvious themes going on here, a discussion of ecology versus technology—
10:25
OMINOUS FIGURE: If you want to talk about how great nature is and how bad technology is, why don't you go live in the woods?
10:31
You wouldn't do that, though, would you? You wouldn't have your precious lattes to drink while you complain on your iPhone about capitalism.
10:38
I don't drink lattes! What the fuck are you talking about?
10:43
By now, you've probably noticed a fairly strong contradiction in the comic between the crass, random non-canon of the many parts intended purely for no-strings-attached comedy,
10:54
the serious parts where Buckley himself definitely doesn't personally threaten someone, and the actual serious lives of the main characters who have problems that don't go away.
11:04
The comic keeps reverberating back and forth, going to further and further extremes. Sometimes you'd get a story where Lucas goes on a date with a woman who turns out to be fat,
11:13
so he awkwardly pretends to be interested for, er, ""hilarious"" ""comedy"", and then they go back to her place, and it turns out she was only pretending to be fat as a test,
11:24
and they start a relationship that lasts for five years of the comic. Then you'd get a chef character saying nonsense for a joke,
11:31
and then something random happens, or maybe you'd get the Players, four characters whose whole deal is they murder each other in different ways over & over.
11:38
Then it turns out Ethan's girlfriend is pregnant. Then they joke about ""what if the guns in the new Gears of War game
11:43
were guns with trains instead of chainsaws?"" You snap back and forth so quickly, you get whiplash of the mind.
11:51
The tension between the comic's supposed reality and meaningless comic fantasy world eventually snapped when,
11:56
during a scene at Ethan's job where he's making a joke about consumers being stupid and not knowing as much about games as him,
12:03
he gets a phone call. Lilah, the comedy video game girlfriend character, is in the hospital...
12:10
because she's had a miscarriage. This culminates in perhaps the most well known page of a comic in history.
12:20
[MUSIC DRAMATICALLY SWELLS]
12:34
When asked by a noted art scholar the appropriate distance from which to stand when viewing his magnum opus,
12:40
plainly entitled ""Loss"", Tim Buckley famously responded, ""What? Fuck you,""
12:47
and banned me from his forum. The release of ""Loss"" profoundly shook the edifice of its audience.
12:55
People were equal parts shocked, horrified, surprised, offended, and completely mystified.
13:04
The semi-serious but still mostly jokey plot parts of the story are utterly shattered, giving way to a harsh and cold reality
13:11
where characters who, in other contexts, have committed or received tremendous acts of violence are suddenly capable of a genuine moment of horrific suffering.
13:19
A comic famous for using too many words to say nothing at all about a video game on a stationary couch
13:25
takes four panels and zero words to show a horrifying discovery and a trip through an entire hospital.
13:32
A gaming webcomic— a comedy gaming webcomic— has an arc in it about the characters having to deal with the miscarriage of their child!
13:40
This comic struck a nerve on the internet. Over nine years later, people are still making fun of it.
13:47
This comic has been parodied and referenced in memes an uncountable amount of times. Entire web pages have been dedicated to tracking them all, and failed to contain them.
13:57
In the next two comics, the characters struggle to even react to what has happened.
14:02
[READING FROM COMIC] ""It's breaking my heart to watch her hurt like this."" The next comic is a joke about how there aren't enough dragons in Dungeons and Dragons anymore.
14:10
The next comic is a single panel of the four Players about to murder each other. For the next little while, the comic switched between dumb video game jokes
14:18
and Buckley trying desperately to restore the comfortable, consequence-free tone he had developed over the five years of the comic.
14:25
It takes at least eight pages before Ethan can go back to making goggles out of pineapples.
14:33
By late November, the characters have fully patched up their problems and they get married, and we get tearful speeches about how important these characters are to each other.
14:41
FEMALE VOICE, MELODRAMATIC: ""Life dropped an epic husband, the rarest of its loot table,
14:48
and I was lucky enough to win the need roll."" [WEDDING BELLS, APPLAUSE]
14:53
Then, for about four years, the comic was basically standalone silly jokes interspersed with bits where there were mini-comics set in a universe like Star Wars for some reason.
15:02
One could say that, with the advent of ""Loss"", a lesson had been learned:
15:07
don't put one of the most emotionally traumatizing events a human can experience
15:14
in your... comedy gaming webcomic! Then, in September 2012,
15:19
Ethan tried to build a time machine, and a future version of Ethan comes through it and kidnaps him into the future.
15:25
The next two months of comics were an extended storyline in which it turns out that Ethan's actions destroy most of humanity,
15:31
as the robot he builds eventually goes insane & murders everyone he loves, and takes over the world. But in the process, the time machine is damaged and threatens to destroy all of time.
15:41
So Ethan has to sacrifice himself to turn the machine off, killing him and saving the future,
15:46
as his inner monologue makes a tearful goodbye to a character no one really cares about because she's basically just written to be a love interest for the author stand-in.
15:54
Ethan, our main character, dies. He dies in the most convoluted fashion possible, and no one ever learns what happened.
16:03
Now that's how you end a... Except it didn't end. It's still been going for five more years,
16:10
but with just the self-contained sketches and the characters from the old version in a rebooted form. The comic somehow continues to limp on.
16:17
It literally killed its main character, and then it just sort of started again.
16:23
So, that... that was CAD! CAD was mean-spirited, hateful and angry.
16:31
CAD was a... a judgmental, tone-deaf, self-righteous screed of a webcomic, and...
16:39
Wait. [STATIC] I'm warning you. Don't do this, man. Don't go there.
16:47

[STATIC] Hi, I'm Hareton Splimby, and welcome to— What the fuck is happening?!
17:48
[THEME MUSIC STUTTERING] Tommy Wiseau's infamous film The Room asks some really interesting questions about how we look at art.
17:57
No, seriously! Come on! STAY WITH ME HERE...!! In terms of pure filmmaking skill, of course, it's awful.
18:03
The script is a nightmare, it's poorly edited, with random shots of San Francisco just kinda slammed in there,
18:09
it has such below average shot composition and mise en scène that I actually feel bad for even saying those words,
18:15
and the ADR is terrible, too. ""Yeah, can I have a dozen red roses, please?"" ""Oh, hi, Johnny. I didn't know it was you.""
18:23
- ""Here you go."" - ""That's me."" - ""How much is it?"" - ""It'll be $18."" - ""Here you go, keep the change. Hi, doggy."" - ""You're my favorite customer.""
18:30
""Thanks a lot. Bye!"" It has a reputation for being a hilariously bad film everyone can laugh at for being bad...
18:36
AUDIENCE MEMBER: This is a bad movie! [LAUGHTER] ...made even more interesting by the incredibly weird performance of Wiseau.
18:43
""I'm fed up with this world!"" But I think, under the proper lens, the film has a little more to say to its audience
18:51
than ""look at me, I'm so bad."" Tommy Wiseau didn't write a film about a perfect guy who gets cheated on by his girlfriend and basically has his life ruined for no reason,
19:00
and he didn't choose to play that perfect guy for no reason either. And here, taking a particular critical look,
19:06
I think a valuable message can be learned from the film. The film has often been criticized in terms of its base components, like writing or acting.
19:15
Lisa, for example, behaves completely irrationally or perhaps with deliberate malice towards Johnny...
19:20
""I have him wrapped around my little finger."" - ""Well, you should be happy, then."" - ""But I don't love him.""
19:26
...suddenly falling out of love with him and cheating on him, and then spreading lies about him for seemingly no reason.
19:31
""You're lying, I never hit you!"" - ""You are tearing me apart, Lisa!"" - ""Why are you so hysterical?""
19:38
I contend here that Wiseau based the play script that would later become the film on an actual life experience,
19:45
an actual breakup that really happened at some point in his life. ""I treat you like a princess, and you stab me in the back.
19:53
I love you, and I did anything for you to just please you, and now you betray me! How could you love him?!""
20:01
[SCREAMS] I'm not saying the events happened exactly as Tommy writes them; in fact, they definitely didn't.
20:07
Obviously, Tommy didn't kill himself, and obviously, women don't grow distant from the people they're in a relationship with for no reason.
20:13
""Women change their minds all the time."" The Room is a fictionalized, exaggerated representation
20:19
of what Tommy *thinks* happened in this real relationship, being completely, perhaps even incoherently, honest about why he thinks it fell apart.
20:28
And it's clear that he thinks it fell apart because his girlfriend started acting weird and crazy and trying to hurt him.
20:34
What's important here is to understand that, to Tommy, this is genuinely how he views this woman.
20:39
This character is, to him, an honest expression of that person. But there has to have been a real Lisa once,
20:46
and her perspective— her side of the story— isn't told. We don't get to see the things Tommy did that led her to move on from him or cheat on him,
20:53
and we only have Tommy's word that he wasn't abusive and was a really good guy. And maybe the fact he genuinely thought to depict this woman as a monster trying to ruin his life
21:03
says something about how he understands other people and their feelings. The Room, precisely with its unrealistic, biased inaccuracy,
21:12
accurately depicts why breakups actually happen; people don't fully understand how the other person feels and begin to think of them as malicious figures,
21:21
because that's the only way we can make sense of people when we don't fully understand them. I've talked to plenty of guys about breakups, and very often you get the same old story just like this one,
21:31
where their partner turned out to be a crazy bitch who just wanted to hurt them.
21:36
But if you're ever lucky enough to hear the other side of a story like that, they're often just frustrated with people who can so easily view them like that if they have a few arguments.
21:44
Wiseau tried to make a film about his breakup, but it turned out to be a film about his inability to understand why it happened.
21:53
No... No... No... The Room is a filmed version of the real, heavily distorted perspective on breakups that many heterosexual men often have.
22:04
And in many ways, when you look at the film this way, it serves as a call to action to learn to see past the Lisas we think we see,
22:11
and understand that relationships tend to fall apart for a reason, and we can learn to do better by seeing people for who they are.
22:18
For all its actual flaws, and even because of some of its clearly deeply flawed misogynistic writing,
22:24
The Room ends up being an actually valuable demonstration of the distorted ways people perceive relationships,
22:30
and how this eventually destroys them, better than any film made by, say, I dunno,
22:36
any man actually working in Hollywood right now, especially the ones currently cashing in on the popularity of The Room.
22:45
Hi, I'm Ha— [SCREAMS] [SHRIEKING VIOLINS]
22:52
[SHOUTS] [TEST TONE, DECREASING IN PITCH]
23:01
[FADES OUT] As you might be aware, EA recently closed Visceral Games,
23:07
the studio working on a Star Wars game that had been in the works for a long time, being worked on by, among many others,
23:13
the director and writer of most of the Uncharted games, but also one of the best written game series ever— Legacy of Kain—
23:19
and pivoting the entire game away from what was being made. This update posted on EA's website by Patrick Söderlund, vice president of EA, cites
23:28
""fundamental shifts in the marketplace."" Single-player linear experiences simply aren't profitable enough,
23:34
at least compared to certain other recent kinds of experience that emphasize time investment and incentivize further transactions made over the course of a single product, rather than a simple one-off purchase.
23:45
This is one of many management decisions that exists in a marketplace driven by the forces inherent to a capitalist society.
23:51
The decision is, sadly, the result of the overall company goal to continue to grow and satisfy investors,
23:57
and this practice trumps creative freedom or what games players might actually want to see.
24:03
Penny Arcade covered this story by featuring one of the two main characters, a stand-in for the author, directly, personally calling Patrick Söderlund an incoherent, art destroying monster.
24:14
[READING FROM COMIC] ""Literally the only thing I know about you is that you destroy things."" ""Jobs, art, I mean, where should I even start?""
24:22
""What you did is bad for games, bad for gamers, and trying to frame it as anything but cowardice is offensive.""
24:30
Penny Arcade is consistently cited as far better than CAD, because CAD's just a bunch of nonsensical rants, and it keeps just using violence as a punch—
24:39
No, wait, this is Penny Arcade's violence! How did this get in here? This is obviously hilarious! Oh my God, he was killed by a gun! [FORCED LAUGHTER]
24:46
Here's to another two decades of comedy gold and insightful commentary
24:52
ON THE FUTURE OF GAMING. Penny Arcade got so popular and influential on the back of this stuff
24:59
that its convention, PAX, is one of the biggest industry events of the year, with even major companies showing off games there.
25:06
CAD also had a convention of its own for a couple of years, labeled Digital Overload.
25:11
And, I hesitate to admit, things don't get popular enough to have an entire convention
25:17
without being at least partially accurate reflections of their audience. ""CTRL+ALT+DEL kicks ass.""
25:22
""I think it's awesome, I've been reading it for a while, and it incorporates a lot of the best things in life, as well as being hilarious.""
25:28
""Tim Buckley is a genius. Period."" I hope the problem here is clear. Even the most intelligent, well-paid, popular,
25:36
and, uh, verbose writers gaming culture has to offer seem unaware that these decisions are not made in a vacuum,
25:44
that games are threatened not by a secretive anti-art coward, but by an environment that systematically crushes most of the people who work on them
25:52
in order to make its owners and shareholders vastly rich, and which has no interest in anything's intrinsic value.
25:59
Gaming culture is largely unable to conceive of this level of socio-economic criticism, of analysis of systemic problems and wider issues with society beyond one person's individual failings,
26:10
and therefore cannot accurately fathom exactly what is damaging the things they love.
26:15
Instead, they have to fantasize about their very own Lisa hiding somewhere in EA, trying to kill art like some kind of fucking Disney villain!
26:25
- [EVIL LAUGHTER] - *This* is why people hate CAD so much. Not because it's bad, no. Bad things come and go all day, every day.
26:33
CAD is such a source of focus and aggression, with millions and millions of words written about how awful it and its creator is,
26:40
because it's an embarrassment. It makes everyone else near it look bad, because as bad as it is, it managed to be honest.
26:49
So people have to try as hard as they can to project these things away from them, try to shift the blame onto Buckley himself and away from the fact they share a lot of the same perspectives.
27:00
Think again about that Jack Thompson comic. No one just ends up in a position where they'll write something like this all on their own.
27:07
Jack Thompson, wrong and dishonest as he was, received thousands of death threats and messages full of harassment for years
27:15
from people just like Tim, or people who had been influenced by this comic. No, CAD is merely a particularly silly and vulgar expression of a broader set of bad ideas
27:25
that continue to go largely unexamined by the people who hold them. Tim Buckley's disjointed personal philosophy and lack of skill didn't come from nowhere.
27:34
We don't get to pretend he's just some random guy. Blaming one man for the flaws of a broken economic system is making the same mistake
27:43
as blaming Tim Buckley for accurately presenting the culture in which he exists. We just have to learn to accept that there might be a lesson in things we hate about us,
27:53
that even if it's bad and we don't like it, we have more in common with it than we want to admit, and can even learn something from it.
28:00
CAD turned out to be reflective of the cultural reality that produced it, and people are only angry at it this much because they don't like what they saw in the mirror.
28:21
(OMINOUS MUSIC)
29:49
When we look at ridiculous behavior within our sphere, instead of trying to project it out of ourselves,
29:56
and say it's just some random idiot somewhere doing something dumb,
30:02
maybe we should accept that CAD, Penny Arcade, Visceral Games and even EA's business decisions
30:08
are aspects of a wider culture that can be reflective of our own feelings and beliefs and values,
30:15
even if we don't like what comes out of them. And maybe if we learn to criticize ourselves and change our own behavior,
30:23
we can start to change the wider culture.

In mid-2015, less than a year before her death, author Harper Lee published her second novel, Go Set a Watchman,
0:14
a sequel to her first and only other published novel, 1960's To Kill a Mockingbird.
0:19
Though the book was published 55 years after To Kill a Mockingbird, it is generally accepted now that Go Set a Watchman was actually written concurrent to,
0:26
or even before, To Kill a Mockingbird. And in the process of writing To Kill a Mockingbird,
0:31
rather than encouraging her to create the entire omnibus, the publisher urged Lee to focus on the childhood aspect, and not on Scout becoming an adult
0:38
and growing into a more complete understanding of who her father Atticus Finch was. Generations of people had grown up with Atticus Finch,
0:45
played with such power and pathos by Gregory Peck in the 1962 film adaptation, only to then have the author swoop in 55 years later and remove the halo adorning Atticus Finch.
0:56
There is some debate as to whether or not the publisher took advantage of Harper Lee, given her age and the fact that she may not have been in position of her full faculties when Go Set a Watchman was published.
1:05
But it is kind of out there now that Go Set a Watchman was always kind of a part of her authorial intent. To Kill a Mockingbird was written from the point of view of an adult, reflecting the understanding of a child.

But Go Set a Watchman changed the framing of Atticus, allowing for a more complete picture of the worldview of white landowners in the South,
1:20
even the nicest ones. Atticus wasn't an activist; he wasn't terribly concerned with the plight of Black Americans in the Jim Crow South,
1:27
he was just a really good lawyer who got appointed this guy's public defender. And he didn't want to lose a case.
1:33
That Go Set a Watchman brought Atticus Finch - the moral pillar of American literature - down to the level of flawed human was heresy to some.
1:40
Atticus was integral to the childhoods of so many. Why? Why add this unasked-for perspective?
1:46
Why did you ruin Atticus, Harper Lee? Why did you do it?
1:51
And I get that you're wondering why, in an episode about The Hobbit, the intro is about Harper Lee and Go Set a Watchman.
1:57
Well, we'll get to that. But first:
2:06
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is so good, it makes me angry. ""'I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.""
2:16
Like, this was lightning in a bottle. We will never see anything like this again. This was back when franchises were a gamble, and Fellowship had a massive gun to its head:
2:25
to do well, or sink not only the rest of the franchise, but also everyone involved's career. It HAD to be great, and the result was so tight and streamlined
2:34
that not only did it become one of the most lucrative trilogies in film history, it changed film itself.
2:39
11 years passed, and the Lord of the Rings films still elicited positive feelings... ""Gimli!""
2:49
Mostly... Then came the Hobbit trilogy.
2:56
At the time, consensus was that these movies were, at best, a mediocre bloated mess with some enjoyable moments.
3:02
Having as intimate of knowledge as I did with the source material and the first film trilogy, I was pretty disillusioned from the get-go:
3:09
bored to death by the first one, and by that point already tapped out, seeing the second one in theaters only out of a morbid sense of obligation,
3:16
and not bothering at all with the third film. But the Lord of the Rings came out at a particularly formative time in my development.
3:22
I said back in 2012 that it was the first film trilogy that got me actively interested in filmmaking, and that is true.
3:28
But that in itself is a form of bias. I wanted The Hobbit to make me feel like The Lord of the Rings did when I was a kid!
3:34
And it didn't, so I hated it! ""Why does it hurt so much?""
3:39
""Because it was real."" It's been nearly 17 years since Fellowship, and six years since the release of the first Hobbit film.
3:46
So maybe now is the time to re-examine the Hobbit. You cannot disentangle it from The Lord of the Rings - the film itself doesn't want you to.
3:53
But maybe I was judging the Hobbit for what it wasn't, rather than what it was. So let's reexamine The Hobbit. Let's try and give it a fair shake...
4:03
""Da, why are there dwarves coming out of our toilet?"" ""You are a coward."" ""Coward? Not every man's brave enough to wear a corset!""
4:11
...if that's even possible.
4:21
The Hobbit trilogy was released between 2012 and 2014, under the subtitles ""An Unexpected Journey,"" ""The Desolation of Smaug,"" and ""The Battle of Five Armies.""
4:29
The creative team behind the Hobbit is almost uniformly the same as that from the Lord of the Rings, with one curious addition:
4:35
""For better or worse, you're as known for the movie you didn't do,
4:40
""The Hobbit, as the ones that you did."" We'll get to that. A huge chunk of the cast returned to reprise their roles from Lord of the Rings,
4:48
most notably Ian McKellen as Gandalf, Andy Serkis as Gollum, and Hugo Weaving as Elrond,
4:53
and adding in not-in-the-Hobbit Rings characters such as Legolas, Saruman, Galadriel, and even Frodo.
4:59
And Radagast is here, too. But that is not to imply that none (sic) of the new elements for The Hobbit were bad.
5:04
Far from it - some of them were inspired. Martin Freeman as Bilbo is pitch-perfect casting.
5:10
""Incineration?"" Freeman has spent much of his entire career since the original Office playing the put-upon everyman.
5:20
And that layer of wit combined with his innate sincerity works really well here. The opening scene with Gandalf and Bilbo,
5:27
(after roughly 20 minutes of prologue, anyway) is almost verbatim from the book. McKellen perfectly bridges the whimsical, mercurial, difficult Gandalf of The Hobbit
5:37
with the Serious Business Gandalf of Rings.
5:49
There are also some story changes that improve the overall film. For instance, having the choice to go on the adventure be Bilbo's idea, rather than Gandalf effectively forcing him into it.
5:58
""I'm going on an adventure!"" Benedict Cumberbatch's Smaug is honestly one of his career highlights.
6:04
""I smell you.... I hear your breath.""
6:11
And I wish I had as much fun at anything in my life as Cumberbatch does playing Smaug. ""How do you choose to die?""
6:20
The scene where Bilbo and Smaug talk for the first time - at least until it starts going on for way too long - ranks alongside any of the best scenes from Rings.
6:32
Adding in small details like Smaug being able to see Bilbo, which he couldn't in the book, is another positive change that just adds more drama to the scene.
6:40
Even Lee Pace as Thranduil brings a sort of otherworldly dimension to a character in the book who is just, you know, some greedy jerk.
6:47
It was also necessary to develop Bard as a character before he kills Smaug. In the book he's just an ascended extra with no lines before he shows up with his bow to kill the dragon.
6:56
There are dozens more great details I could go into: the elves only eating, like, kale...
7:01
the dwarves being horrified by that... ""Try it! Just a mouthful.""
7:07
""I don't like green food."" Even Gimli's gratuitous cameo doesn't bother me. ""What is this horrid creature? A goblin mutant?""
7:16
""That's my wee lad, Gimli."" The problem with the Hobbit isn't the absence of good; good in it exists.
7:23
It is more the whole weighing less than the sum of its parts. These positive elements are often used as refutations of criticism of The Hobbit.
7:30
But to say that the presence of good outweighs the pacing issues, the unnecessary plot cul-de-sacs,
7:35
the terrible visual effects the clumsy integration of irrelevant plot points...
7:42
""Sorry."" Yeah, I, uh... I'm starting to remember why these movies frustrated me so much.
7:53
The Hobbit was published 20 years before the Lord of the Rings was published and itself had to be reissued to fit with the new version of Middle-Earth Tolkien created,
8:01
and, even still, is tonally a completely different animal from the Lord of the Rings. Meanwhile, The Hobbit movies have the opposite problem,
8:07
billed as prequels to movies that had come out a decade prior. Add into this the popularity of all parties involved:
8:12
The Hobbit is one of the best-selling books of all time at over 100 million copies, shy of Lord of the Rings's 150-odd million copies.
8:19
So, on the one hand, the filmmakers are tasked with creating faithful adaptations of one of the best-selling books of all time.
8:25
On the other hand, the filmmakers are tasked with creating prequels to one of the best-selling film trilogies of all time.
8:30
So roadblock number one: the Lord of the Rings was written as a sequel to the Hobbit. The Hobbit was not written as a prequel to Lord of the Rings.
8:37
And we have to be faithful to both, but in publication order, the prequel was not a prequel. It wasn't even originally planned to have any sequels.
8:44
And as a consequence, the central conflict of the Hobbit, dwarves finding a treasure, and then a bunch of people fighting over it,
8:50
has nothing to do with the central conflict of the Lord of the Rings, which is that the magic ring Bilbo found on his adventure
8:55
oops it's evil and will destroy the world Compare this with the Star Wars prequels, which, love them or hate them,
9:00
""You were the chosen one!"" their central conflicts do directly set up the plots of the original Star Wars trilogy:
9:07
how the Empire formed, how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader, what the Clone Wars were,
9:13
The gang's all here. The Hobbit doesn't really work as a prequel to the Lord of the Rings because neither the conflict nor the tone flow into it.
9:20
If they really wanted to do a prequel to the Lord of the Rings, one that set up the universe, how the magic rings worked, how they came into existence,
9:27
who Sauron is and where he came from, why he had control over the Rings of Power,
9:32
The real prequel to the Lord of the Rings with a similar epic tone was The Silmarillion. Said Tolkien himself of the Lord of the Rings in a letter to his publisher:
9:44
But that wasn't the Lord of the Rings prequel anyone wanted. We ain't gonna adapt no dense myth-heavy Silmarillion with its paltry less than a million copies sold.
9:53
Oh no, precious. We wanted the Hobbit.
9:59
""Fair enough."" The truth is, the Hobbit existing in the same universe and having to logically progress into the Lord of the Rings
10:05
presented huge problems for Tolkien. And a lot of what we know as The Hobbit wasn't there in the original publication.
10:11
Tolkien made dozens of tiny changes for the 1951 reissue of The Hobbit, preceding the original printing of the Lord of the Rings.
10:17
But the biggest change was an almost total rewrite of Riddles in the Dark. In the original version, Gollum was a much more quirky, less sinister character,
10:24
and he gave Bilbo the Ring as a gift when Bilbo won the riddle contest. The One Ring was not yet the One Ring.
10:30
It was just a magic ring that would be really useful. A nice magic ring, but there was no intent to flow into something more epic.
10:37
The Necromancer that Gandalf uses as an excuse to leave the dwarves at Mirkwood, We find out in the Lord of the Rings that that was Sauron the whole time
10:43
And oh boy, oh boy, do they play that up in The Hobbit movies! ""Sauron....""
10:50
This character, of course, was not originally intended to be Sauron. The Necromancer, according to Tolkien was...
11:02
So I get why people defend that decision on the part of the filmmakers to include Sauron, but to state that that was Tolkien's original intent... that's pretty disingenuous.
11:13
But the biggest problem was in keeping the same plot, while making the Hobbit also a tonal prequel to the Lord of the Rings.
11:19
The Hobbit - the novel - has a wildly different tone from the Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings take place in the same universe, but only nominally.
11:27
Many, if not most, of the details of the history of Middle-earth existed only in sketch form. And Tolkien's beloved Silmarillion - which yes, he'd started even before the Hobbit was published -
11:35
would change dramatically as Tolkien developed the Lord of the Rings. But when the Hobbit was a success, and Tolkien's publisher asked for a sequel,
11:42
Tolkien didn't really know where he wanted to go with it. It took him several years to realize that the world of The Hobbit had effectively grown up when his children did,
11:49
and he wanted to write an epic fantasy for adults. Because the Lord of the Rings both didn't hit the original target audience, children,
11:56
but then again, it did. Part of the reason why the Lord of the Rings feels more grown-up is because his kids,
12:01
and by extension the original kids who read it when it was published, were growing up with the stories. And Tolkien's oldest son Christopher was integral to the creation of the book.
12:09
The Hobbit was a children's story written before any serious publisher would dare entertain the idea of epic fantasy literature for adults.
12:15
It was published at a time where fantasy was either Le Petit Prince or Beowulf. And the Lord of the Rings, even 20 years later, was kind of a huge gamble,
12:22
one that paid off right away and has never been out of print since. Tolkien wrote to a fan in 1955:
12:36
Both The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings were stories for Tolkien's children, but at different stages of life.
12:43
You can either make a faithful adaptation of The Hobbit, one that is fun and clever and matches the childlike tone of the books,
12:48
which were designed to be read aloud at story-time and even include quick asides for the reader, or you can make three three-hour prequels to Lord of the Rings,
12:56
that match the tone and epic scope of the Lord of the Rings, but they can't be the same thing.
13:01
The Hobbit is about 95,000 words long, about 5,000 words shorter than the first Hunger Games book,
13:07
and about 12,000 words longer than the first Harry Potter book. To compare, the Fellowship of the Ring alone is nearly twice that length at 177,000 words,
13:15
with the entirety of the Lord of the Rings cashing in at about 1.5 Games of Thrones. and that doesn't even include the appendices.
13:22
This is not to say that the Hobbit needed to be the same length as the first Hunger Games movie, in order not to feel flabby.
13:27
The Hobbit has an extremely minimalistic style for all that goes down in it, compared with the florid Lord of the Rings with its extreme attention to detail.
13:34
Adapting The Hobbit as it is without adding any pauses for character development, or pacing, or world building, would have made a film that felt incredibly rushed.
13:42
Even though the book is Hunger Games short, a lot more goes down in it, and it would feel way too rushed as a 90 minute movie or even one 3 hour movie,
13:50
so I think the initial pitch of two 2 hour movies directed by Guillermo del Toro could have led to the creation of a great, original, memorable product,
13:58
both in the spirit of the original novel, yet distinct from the Lord of the Rings film trilogy. ""Why does it hurt so much?""
14:06
""Because it was real.""
14:13
Maybe they got that version in the Berenstein universe.
14:21
To explore the challenges of adapting the Hobbit, first we must examine the structure. It has a beginning, middle, and end - kinda -
14:28
but it doesn't really have the structure of a Hollywood screenplay, let alone three Hollywood screenplays.
14:33
Compare it to the Fellowship of the Ring. The book doesn't really have a three-act structure per se, but without changing much, the film gets rid of the Tom Bombadil stuff -
14:41
good call, that - has the end of act 1 as Frodo leaving the Shire, and also has a really long act 2, with the midpoint being Frodo taking the ring to Mordor.
14:48
""I will take the ring to Mordor!"" And act 3 comprising a big action scene where Frodo escapes while Aragorn and the others fight the Uruk-Hai
14:54
And Boromir gets a much more emotional death than he does in the book. Not a whole lot of rearranging needed to turn this into a three-act Hollywood structure.
15:01
But the Hobbit is way more episodic, with the individual adventures rarely...
15:07
changing the quest. The book pulls a great deal from English folk tales, fairy stories, epics, and Norse poems like Beowulf,
15:14
so it includes elements that might otherwise feel out of place in a novel, because of the story's basis.
15:19
Plot points that feel out of nowhere or anticlimactic, like Ascended Extra Bard killing the dragon instead of Bilbo or the dwarves,
15:26
or Smaug having one weakness, is very rooted in mythology and folk stories: Fafnir, Beowulf, Odysseus...
15:31
And as it ends up in the movies, boy is it anticlimactic!
15:40
This did not need to be so hideously anticlimactic, except for the way that they structured it. The third movie begins with the burning of Laketown, and Smaug dies...
15:49
...before the opening title. This, like so many things, is a consequence of restructuring. Smaug's death should have been the midpoint of the second film, not the, um...
15:59
prologue to the third? The structure of the Hobbit is episodic and meandering. Not a lot of build like we see in the Lord of The Rings.
16:05
Each chapter is a mini adventure in which Bilbo either learns something, gets something, or earns respect.
16:10
It is effectively designed to be read by adults to children, one chapter per night. The Leonard Nimoy Ode to Bilbo Baggins song captures this pretty well:
16:18
""Well he fought with the goblins!"" ""He battled a troll!""
16:25
""He riddled with Gollum!"" ""A magic ring he stole!"" The decision to split this book into three makes this into even more of a problem,
16:33
because we need to split this tiny books into act 1 act 2 and act 3, three times.
16:38
This results in adding mini climaxes that don't go anywhere, character moments that come either too early or too late,
16:44
And several elements that just don't translate. Bilbo has nothing to do during the Battle of Five Armies, and is unconscious for most of it.
16:50
This isn't so much a problem in the book as the Battle of Five Armies takes up all of like half a chapter, but they went and made it take two hours of a two hour and 44 minute movie that relegates Bilbo into a minor role
17:01
and most of the dwarves as glorified extras. But the worst problems don't arise because the book was a challenge to adapt.
17:06
There was a good movie in this mess if you edit out, like, half of it. It's the horrible structure problems that arise from the decision to split two films into three,
17:14
a matter of months before the first film was set to be released. So character beats need to be shuffled around not only according to the needs of adaptation,
17:21
but according to the needs of film structures. So this moment where Thorin finally respects Bilbo happens here:
17:31
Rather than after Bilbo frees the dwarves in the barrels, where it was likely originally intended to have happened and where it makes more sense to have happened
17:38
because Bilbo had repeatedly proven himself to Thorin by that point. But in the final version, where Thorin has to respect Bilbo before the Eagles rescue them,
17:46
the one action Bilbo gets is to... bum-rush an orc... like a linebacker.
17:52
And it makes that plot point weaker, because Bilbo freeing the dwarves through his cunning and magic ring is what makes him valuable to the party.
17:58
He doesn't think like them, and his wits are his greatest asset. So his prove-myself-to-Thorin moment being, like, a football tackle just makes a rushed moment all the weaker.
18:07
Bilbo's not a linebacker. He's a hobbit. He's The Hobbit!
18:13
And now Bilbo and Thorin's relationship has zero development throughout movie 2. It's just kind of at a par and then they have their falling out in 3.
18:21
""When you decided to make three instead of two movies, ""isn't it hard to split a story arc from two into three?""
18:29
""Well, it was actually better. ""I mean we- we made that decision because it was going to be, ""We thought it was going to be a better shape. I mean it was our decision, that wasn't a studio decision.""
18:38
Really? Really?? I find that VERY hard to believe.
18:44
The original first film was set to end once the party got to either Erebor or Laketown. Part two would have been getting into Erebor, everything with Smaug, and then Five Armies.
18:53
So the nonsense climaxes of movies 1 and 2 which... involves so much...
18:59
What? What?? Are dwarves heat-resis-
19:05
Metal doesn't... what? What?
19:11
The need for these contrived climaxes that add nothing to the overall narrative directly traced back to that 11th hour decision to turn two movies into three.
19:19
Because all movies are trilogies now. ""Is this two or three?"" ""Oh, it's three, is it?""
19:24
""Is this three, yeah?"" ""It's three, there you go."" ""It's that easy to be confused.""
19:29
And then there was the stuff they added. Oh, and the stuff they added. ""Aren't you going to search me?""
19:37
""I could have anything down my trousers."" Again to compare to the Lord of the Rings, because we have to, they cut just as much out of the novels as they added into the films,
19:45
and most of what they added was some expansion on material from the appendices, most notably Aragorn and Arwen.
19:50
At the front, when Arwen rescues Frodo, is more of a change rather than an addition, and again a positive one in my opinion.
19:56
In the book Frodo is rescued by a character who never appears again. So making it Aragorn's one true love makes that plot point stronger.
20:03
In the Two Towers, they also added a warg battle, and Aragorn getting separated, and a bunch of scenes with Arwen, and Arwen leaving and then coming back,
20:12
Frodo and Sam have a tiff in the Return of the King, which you know I'm not a fan of, but I guess I get why they got it...
20:19
Gollum framing Sam which is kind of dumb, but okay? And then there's the scene at Osgiliath at the end of Two Towers that gives Frodo and Sam a climax in the second movie...
20:28
Those are kind of like the only major additions. They cut out a few chapters like Tom Bombadil and the Scouring of the Shire entirely,
20:35
but they didn't add that much in the grand scheme. Here's some of the stuff they added to the Hobbit:
20:42
The White Council, this orc mini boss who's in all three films, fighting dragon priests,
20:50
Evangeline Lilly Legolas fighting that endlessly long barrel river chase scene between orcs and elves and we're fighting
20:58
Kíli's hot and he's in love! Gandalf and Galadriel..... huh?
21:08
Legolas fighting Radagast the Browwwnnn He's got poop on his head!
21:14
useless framing device the entire climax of Desolation Evangeline Lilly is in a love triangle
21:20
Legolas is soooo coooooool wow this framing device sure is going on forever B I L B O L I N E B A C K E R
21:26
did they fuck? side quest to Angmar that goes nowhere Stephen Fry's horrible henchman
21:31
WHAT IS HAPPENING on-screen White Council scene God Alfred is awful look at Legolas gooooooooooooo
21:37
Bard the bowman has a family now! Beorn needed a bear chase scene ""Come with me, my lady!""
21:44
Gandalf she's married! Gratuitous Elijah Wood cameo True love!!!!!
21:49
and that's like not even half of it.
21:56
This ties in with other adaptational problems; namely the problem of The Hobbit being so different and more childlike -
22:01
read ""cartoonish"" - in tone than the more gritty adult Lord of the Rings. First the Battle of Five Armies... Just... all of it...
22:09
It takes up about half a chapter and Bilbo is unconscious. So of course this needed to be expanded, but the result is longer than the Battle of Helm's Deep.
22:16
Which itself started to drag in the run-up: ""But do not trust to hope."" ""There is no hope."" ""There is still hope.""
22:22
We get it... ""They say that it is hopeless."" We get it! Another consequence of splitting two movies into three is that movie 2 needs a climax now.
22:30
And that is how we got the escape from Smaug scene and the heat-resistant dwarves. It adds a gratuitous action scene that goes on forever,
22:37
but adds absolutely nothing to the narrative plot-wise. Smaug was going to go destroy Laketown either way, so this action scene is bereft of tension in every regard.
22:46
This is a problem in a lot of recent films: studio will mandate X number of action scenes, but these action scenes either have no tension,
22:52
either in the macro sense of how they advance the plot, or in the momentary sense of whether the characters get through or not, and whether we the audience care.
23:00
This is particularly problematic in that the dwarves seem utterly resistant to dragon-fire and to heat in general.
23:05
So there is no physical danger to them, so... Why...
23:11
Thorin... Thorin, you know metal is a conductor, right?
23:16
There is a similar problem in the scene where the dwarves escape the elves. It has a plot-related tension of escape, but the action is so absurd that you can't really feel for these guys.
23:26
They appear to be made of rubber. They don't seem to have any mortality. Kíli gets shot by an arrow, and that's sad and hurts him,
23:33
but meanwhile this is happening
23:41
And cartoons barrel boing-boing all in the same scene! Are these guys impervious or not?
23:46
And if they are impervious, then where is the tension? And then there was the storm giants.
23:52
""This is no thunderstorm!"" ""It's a thunder battle!"" Oh, the storm giants...
23:58
So, like Five Armies takes up about half a chapter, the storm giants (a five-minute scene) takes up about half a sentence.
24:05
Here's the sentence. And according to the annotated Hobbit, most Tolkien scholars don't think of storm giants as like...
24:13
...alternate fantasy creatures that we haven't seen yet. They're... you know, they're just trolls.
24:18
Cave trolls... Troll trolls. Trolls that like to play in the rain and throw rocks. You know, the fun kind of troll. Not the internet kind.
24:28
But speaking of cave trolls, there is a scene in Fellowship that this reminds me of. We're in the Mines of Moria, we've just found out how Balin and all of the dwarves there died,
24:36
""They are coming."" And then Pippin inadvertently causes an extended action scene that goes on for about 20 minutes and ends with Gandalf's death
24:45
You see what I mean about ""action scenes should advance the plot""?! ""NOOOOOOOOO""
24:50
Anyway ""Fool of a Took!"" Before this scene, we've set up the mithril armor.
24:56
""Mithril! As light as a feather, and as hard as dragon-scales.""
25:02
Which Bilbo got from Thorin in The Hobbit, and gifts to Frodo. During the scene, Frodo gets stabbed by the troll.
25:08
Everyone's like ""Oh no he dead,"" but ah, wait! Remember that mithril armor! ""Mithril...""
25:14
So with the storm giant scene, again we're straining believability by oscillating between the mortal -
25:19
Bilbo hanging from a ledge and needing a rescue - and the cartoonish, literally everything else in the scene.
25:25
""The legends are true!"" ""Giants! Storm giants!"" It culminates in this moment: they're on the knee of a giant,
25:33
who ostensibly smashes them into the side of a cliff,
25:39
But no, they're fine. See? They're fine. Whatever, let's go.
25:48
Unlike the troll scene in Fellowship, where Frodo reveals the mithril armor, there is no payoff here.
25:53
No one's skill that had been set up in an earlier scene saves them. It's just a wildly unlikely coincidence that they survive,
26:00
action that goes nowhere and advances nothing. So unlike with Rings, where we have a constant sense of mortality
26:06
and the physical pain these characters are going through, in The Hobbit it's like action figures being smashed together.
26:12
There's never any real sense of danger. When they get caught by goblins, Gandalf shows up, and they cut through them like butter.
26:18
And to be clear, this is not about knowing what the outcome of the scene is, just because you've read the book. You can still feel tension as an audience member, even if you already know what the outcome of the scene is.
26:28
And there's nothing wrong with a playful, cartoony tone in and of itself. But it's really hard to include that in a narrative that also has these dramatic moments of physical danger.
26:37
If this doesn't kill them, and that doesn't kill them, and THAT doesn't kill them,
26:43
then what would? In order to maintain tension, the rules of the universe have to be consistent,
26:49
and we need to believe that these characters are in danger. It goes without saying; Bilbo and Gandalf surviving, for instance, is a foregone conclusion that can't be helped.
26:57
But there are ways to build tension in an already popular story. Fellowship of the Ring takes a character like Boromir, and it fleshes him out
27:04
with an understandable personal conflict and friendship with the hobbits, so that when he does die, it feels way more upsetting and meaningful and well... human than it did in the book.
27:12
Tolkien didn't really care about Boromir as a character. But Jackson and his cowriters keyed in to his humanity,
27:18
and the result is one of the strongest, most memorable performances in all three films. The entire character of Boromir is an excellent example of the way movies can improve upon their source material.
27:29
""Leave it! It is over."" But these are all style choices. To me, the biggest issue with the Hobbit movies was
27:36
instead of letting the movies be The Hobbit...
27:43
The biggest mess in all three films is the attempt to make the central conflict in The Hobbit directly tied in with the central conflict of the Lord of the Rings.
27:49
Because it just isn't, except maybe in that really really distant Silmarillion way, where all bad things like dragons and orcs, etc.,
27:57
all originate from the same bad one dude. (By the way, if you want to go down a fun rabbit hole, Google image search ""Sauron-Melkor fan art"" it is a TRIP)
28:05
Even in Tolkien's awkward retrofit, where we find out that the necromancer was Sauron the whole time, it's almost completely irrelevant to the conflict in The Hobbit.
28:13
Gandalf mentions that Sauron is over here somewhere in the Fellowship of the Ring, But it doesn't really mean anything to either narrative,
28:19
except for helping Gandalf put two and two together when Bilbo starts acting weird. ""You want it for yourself!""
28:24
""BILBO BAGGINS!"" So their solution was to double down on what was, even to Tolkien, kind of a contrived throwaway line to get Gandalf out of the picture.
28:32
""Now, now! I'm already late because of botherings with you people."" It works in a children's story.
28:38
But when you take a plot device to get Gandalf away from the party and then try to develop it into this lush world building
28:44
""Are you in need of assistance, my lady?"" Still, there had to be a better way to make this work.
28:51
Ultimately, there is a rising darkness in the form of the goblins, and the dragons, and the whole thrust of the battle at the end is everyone fighting each other over a petty treasure
29:00
when there is a real, existential threat to all of them. See, the reveal of the Necromancer's identity doesn't actually matter in this story,
29:08
because he doesn't really do anything. This only matters to the audience, who recognizes this character from Lord of the Rings.
29:15
What it is in the book is Gandalf's discovery of the orc army, which we later find out is commanded by Sauron.
29:21
If we wanted to keep Sauron here, sure, have it be THAT angle. But the problem is, they're already being pursued by orcs from the minute go,
29:29
way before we learned that the Necromancer is Sauron. A different orc army, not to be confused with this orc army -
29:36
you know, the one with the worms of Arrakis - but as it is in the final product, the reveal of Sauron is completely meaningless.
29:41
But it could have flown in better, thematically, into the Lord of the Rings. Darkness rising, stop fighting over stupid shit y'all, it's only gonna get worse.
29:50
But more focus is placed on shoehorning in these plot elements and characters from Rings, which makes it just feel flabby and awkward.
29:57
There's one bit in the appendices with Christopher Lee that breaks my heart a little bit. ""If it means something in the story,
30:05
""And it's what the director wants,"" ""So you're using the staff in the hand and like- like so, yep, yep, perfect.""
30:11
""and the audience remembers it, ""that's what it's all about.""
30:17
He and Jackson kind of parted on ba","In which we look back at The Hobbit trilogy and try to give it a fair shake.

Making Games Better for Gamers with Colourblindness & Low Vision | Designing For Disability,"370,306","19,000",8/22/18,13:55,"0:00
Video games are for everyone, and they can even be enjoyed by those who live with disabilities
0:07
if game developers make certain design decisions, or introduce certain options. In this series
0:13
of videos, I’m looking at how to implement some of the most popular and easy options
0:17
to make games better for those with auditory, visual, motor, or cognitive disabilities.
0:23
In this second episode of the show, I’m looking at options for those living with visual impairments such
0:29
as colourblindness, and low vision.
Colourblindness
0:33
Part 1 - Colourblindness
0:36
In Cuphead, it’s easy to tell the difference between these pink punches (which you can
0:41
parry), and the blue ones, (which you can’t). Unless, the game looked liked this.
0:48
And when hacking cameras and whatnot in Bioshock 2, you shouldn’t have a problem differentiating
0:53
between green cells, which give you access, and red cells, which trigger an alarm. Unless,
0:59
the game looked like this.
1:02
This is what playing games can be like for those who have colour vision deficiency - more
1:07
commonly known as being colourblind. That’s when one or more of the receptors in your
1:12
eyes is defective, which can reduce your ability to see a particular chunk of the colour spectrum
1:17
and make it difficult to tell the difference between some hues.
1:20
There are three major types of colour blindness:
1:23
Deuteranopia, which effects the perception of green tones, is the most common form. Protanopia
1:29
is less common, and affects red tones.
1:32
In practice, these two forms of colourblindness look quite similar, and are sometimes referred
1:36
to together as red-green colourblindness.
1:40
And then there’s tritanopia which is very rare, and affects your ability to see yellow
1:43
and, to a lesser extent, blue.
1:46
We use the suffix “anopia” when the cone is completely missing, and the suffix “anomaly”
1:51
when the cone is defective. There’s also the ultra rare achromatopsia, where you literally
1:57
see the world in black and white. And colour vision deficiency can result from physical
2:01
or neurological damage, which can lead to very unique effects.
2:05
Colourblindness affects approximately 1 in 12 men, and 1 in 200 women.
2:11
Developers can check to see if their games are readable by those who are colourblind
2:14
by checking with colourblind gamers, or using free filter tools to simulate what their game
2:20
might look like to people with the three major vision deficiencies.
2:23
A tool like Color Oracle allows you to see static images in a simulated colourblind mode,
2:29
while the program Sim Daltonism can show you the world through colourblind eyes, in real
2:34
time. There are also filters for game engines like Unreal Engine, which is available by
2:38
default, and Unity, which I’ll link to in the description.
2:42
Then, once the filters are applied, developers should see if critical information like HUD
2:47
elements, alerts, enemy differences, crosshairs, explosive barrels, loot rarity, damage indicators,
2:53
or waypoints are lost or difficult to distinguish.
2:57
And so, if you’ve run the filter and realised that colourblind gamers won’t be able to
3:01
see their red laser sight against different backgrounds, or tell the difference between
3:05
the red team and the green team, or pick out the gold loot from the green loop, what do
3:09
you do?
3:11
The best solution is to design around this issue, and simply avoid relying on colour
3:16
alone when communicating information, or distinguishing between two different things.
3:21
Designers should try to use shapes, symbols, shading, animation, and other visual tricks to make critical parts
3:28
of the game stand out from one another.
3:30
Take, for example, Recore: a shooter with colour-coded enemies and weapons, where you’ll
3:36
need to use red bullets on red enemies - and so on. Developer Armature Studio wisely decided
3:42
to not just use colours, but also put high contrast white arrows on the enemy’s health
3:47
bar - left for blue, up for yellow, and right for red - which corresponds to the d-pad direction
3:53
you must press to change to the same-coloured bullets.
3:56
If you don’t want to make these symbols appear for everyone, you can have them as
4:00
part of an optional colourblind mode. A great example of this is the charming colour-swapping
4:05
puzzler Hue, where a colourblind mode applies symbols to the different colours to make them
4:10
visually distinct from one another.
4:13
And in Chromagun, which has to deal with lots of colours and colour combinations, a really
4:18
clever symbol system is used. So there’s a unique symbol for the base colours - a vertical
4:23
line for yellow, a horizontal line for blue, and a circle for red. And then these symbols
4:27
can combine to make the mixtures of orange, purple, and green - and a final one for black.
4:34
That means you can play the game fully, no matter what colours you can and can’t see.
4:38
Where it’s not possible to design around this issue, the next best step is to allow
4:43
players to customise the colours they see on screen.
4:46
The gold standard is Battlefield 1. Here, the squad and enemy colours - that pesky red
4:51
and green again - are hard to distinguish for players with deuteranopia. And the squad
4:55
and team colours - green and blue - merge together for those with tritanopia. So DICE
5:01
provides a colourblind option that lets you swap those four colours for a palette that
5:05
will be more distinguishable for those with different forms of CVD.
5:09
Bonus points for showing the change on the options screen itself, and mega bonus points
5:14
for letting players simply pick four colours of their own choosing from a Photoshop-like
5:18
colour picker.
5:20
Slightly more simple, one-size-fits-all options can be found in Far Cry 5, which changes red
5:25
elements to yellow. And in the Call of Duty games, where a colourblind option swaps the
5:30
classic green and red labels, for team members and enemies, to blue and yellow ones.
5:36
Here’s another good example, from the puzzle game The Spectrum Retreat, which has four
5:40
different coloured blocks to play with. In this game, a colour vision mode has a different
5:44
colour palette for deuteranopia or protanopia, another for tritanopia, and a black and white
5:50
one that will work with achromatopsia and other rare vision deficiencies,
5:54
If you’re looking for a good colour palette for a colourblind mode, use blue and orange
5:58
as your primary colours when contrasting key elements - these will stick out from one another
6:03
for gamers with all three major types of CVD. Beyond that, very light and dark colours will
6:10
also show up, as those with colourblindness can still see differences in brightness, provided
6:15
the difference is strong enough. And, of course, black and white are visible to everyone.
6:20
Now, some developers seem to think that the best solution is to provide a filter that
6:24
will try to recolour the entire screen. But this is tricky to get right, and rarely the
6:29
best approach. Overwatch, for example, has these filters that completely recolour the
6:34
game and while some players do appreciate these filters - for many, they don’t really
6:39
help, and just end up making the game look utterly bonkers.
6:41
These settings shouldn’t mean you experience colours in
6:44
games differently than you perceive them naturally in the real world. Instead, they should simply
6:48
help players to clearly see vital bits of information.
6:52
At least its better than Doom, which somehow managed to include a filter that actually
6:56
simulates the effects of being colourblind, rather than help them. Chuck on deutronopia
7:02
mode, for example, and it just… shows you what the game would look like if you had that
7:06
form of colourblindness. How this ended up in the final game is beyond me.
7:10
And finally, for games where colour combinations keep changing - like the ultra colourful Splatoon
7:16
- it’s good to offer an option that will lock team colours to something universally
7:20
distinguishable - in this case light orange and dark blue - so players will never come
7:25
across a colour combination they can’t see. This doesn’t affect all players, as the
7:29
colours are only locked on the console of the player who chose the option.
Low Vision
7:34
Part Two - Low Vision
7:37
When God of War came out on PS4 this year, many players struggled to enjoy the game for
7:42
one, significant reason: the text size was tiny. Anyone with low vision - or just those
7:49
who are trying to play the game on a smaller TV - would struggle to read the game’s subtitles
7:54
and menus.
7:55
Thankfully, Sony Santa Monica updated the game, and included a slider that lets you
7:59
change the text size. It’s still pretty small, but it’s something.
8:03
And it's a good reminder that games can do better to help players see critical information.
8:08
Because there are a huge range of conditions that can reduce your your field of vision,
8:12
meaning how much you can see, and acuity, meaning how clearly you can see it. But designers
8:17
can work to help those players with design considerations that generally come down to
8:20
two core things: size and contrast.
8:24
So, devs should make text, user interface elements, button prompts and alerts big and
8:30
easy to read. As a rough guide for console games, you should not drop below 28 pixel
8:35
fonts on any UI text, and nothing below 46 pixels for subtitles. Plus, developers should
8:41
try to make them contrast against different backgrounds by using dark shadows or outlines.
8:46
Don’t fall into the trap of only ever testing your game from a computer on your desk - see
8:51
what it looks like on a TV on the other side of the room.
8:55
If you don’t want to do it by default, then at least consider adding in an option. In
8:58
Monster Hunter World, there’s an option that will boost the size of text on the interface
9:02
and tutorial. In Borderlands The Presequel, you can boost the size of the whole user interface
9:07
to make things like your health and ammo easier to see. And in Assassin’s Creed Origins,
9:12
there’s an option to add a black box behind the subtitle text to make it easier to see
9:16
them against the game.
9:18
One more thing to consider is the use of clear, easy-to-read fonts. Sci-fi screen text or
9:23
gothic letterpress or handwritten scribbles might fit the game world, but they can be
9:28
a nightmare to read with low vision, or from a distance. You don’t need to take the personality
9:33
out of your game, though: simply give players the ability to read the on-screen text in
9:37
a standard, sans serif font - like in The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit.
9:42
Another option that benefits players with low vision, is some form of high contrast
9:46
mode that makes critical parts of the game better stand out against the background. Take
9:51
Street Fighter IV, where the animated backgrounds might be beautiful and atmospheric - but they
9:55
can also make it hard to see the actual fighters. A graphical option replaces these backgrounds
10:00
with a simple black room, making Ryu and chums easily visible to all.
10:05
Meanwhile, an indie shmup, Shoot 1UP, lets you choose the opacity of the background layer.
10:10
Drop it down to low, and the unimportant backdrop gets darker - causing enemy ships and bullets
10:16
to stick out like a sore thumb. For some games this can be a really easy option to implement,
10:21
because it’s just a black rectangle between foreground and background.
10:25
It’s also important for a game to have a really vivid soundscape, so that critical
10:29
information can be picked up by those with low vision. It’s easy to know that you’ve
10:33
killed a Combine soldier in Half Life 2, for example, because they play a loud flatlining
10:37
sound when they die.
10:42
In fact, some games can even be played by gamers who are completely blind, if the soundscape
10:47
is detailed and covers all important information.
10:51
Fighting games are a good example of this. Their simple environment, combined with great
10:55
sound design, mean they’re often accessible by default. But some extra considerations
10:59
are needed.
11:01
For example, NetherRealms’s fighting games Injustice and Mortal Kombat X have interactable
11:06
stage elements, and - at the launch of Injustice - the only way to know that you can use them
11:10
is to look out for a white visual cue.
11:13
But after receiving feedback from blind players, the devs added an accessibility option that
11:17
plays a pulsing sound effect if a player is near one of these interactables. The sound
11:22
plays in the left ear of your headphones if you’re stood in front of it, or in the right
11:26
ear if your opponent is. Now, blind gamers can even compete in tournaments.
11:32
Another blind gamer, SightlessKombat, asked the devs of Killer Instinct to add audio cues
11:37
to correspond with HUD elements like the knockdown value meter and the shadow meter - so he knows
11:42
when combos are about to drop, and when special attacks are ready for use. Those sounds are
11:47
now in the game, and there’s a menu option that lets you change the volume of those sounds.
11:51
Because, like in the audio episode, games should let you change the volume of different audio
11:56
sources so players can dip or mute the music to better focus on critical sound effects.
12:02
You can also support screenreaders, which are external pieces of software that can read
12:06
out text from a game. The fighting game Skullgirls, for example, is configured to work with screenreaders,
12:12
and it will read out menu text to low sighted players. This would make lots of sense for
12:17
interface-driven games like Hearthstone, or text-heavy games like visual novels that don’t
12:22
have voice acting. I’ve put some links in the description to some handy resources, if
12:27
you want to consider this option.
12:30
Ultimately, video games are a massively visual medium - which means disabilities that affect
12:36
your vision will undoubtedly affect your ability to play. But smart design choices and handy
12:41
options will make most games way more accessible to those who are colourblind, or live with
12:46
low vision.
12:47
Just remember: don’t rely on colour alone, focus on size and contrast, and invest in
12:52
good audio. Beyond that, make sure you test your games for this stuff - either by working
12:58
with players with disabilities, or simply playing your game on a TV that’s across
13:02
the room, or by using colourblind filters.
13:04
Do that and not only will your game be more accessible - but also help out players who
13:08
are playing on a smaller screen, or squinting to see their TV in a sunny room, or playing
13:13
on a phone in battery saving mode, and so on. As with all accessibility measures, pretty
13:18
much everyone will benefit from a little extra work.
13:24
Thanks for watching! Huge thanks this week to accessibility specialist Ian Hamilton,
13:28
of the Game Accessibility Guidelines, who provided loads of help. Plus, a team of colourblind
13:33
gamers on Twitter who shared their experiences with me.
13:36
Future episodes will cover motor disabilities, as well as cognitive disabilities like simulation
13:40
sickness, epilepsy, and dyslexia. GMTK and Designing for Disability are powered by Patreon.","Video games are for everyone. But disabled people can be left out if developers don’t consider their needs. In this series of videos, I’ll be sharing guidelines and best practices for making games more accessible to a wide range of disabilities. This time, I’m looking at design choices and menu options that will affect those who are colourblind or have low vision.

[Shannon] Grape-kun was a real-life penguin that essentially fell in love with a cardboard cutout of an anime character.
0:10
Grape-kun is the ur-parasocial relationship. We peak with Grape-kun.
0:17
[Bo Burnham] And I was sort of raised in America when it was a cult of self-expression, and I was just taught, you know, express myself and have things to say
0:26
and everyone will care about them. And I think everyone was taught that, and most of us found out no one gives a s*** what we think.
0:33
*Audience laughs* -So we flock to performers by the thousands because we're the few that have found an audience and then I'm supposed to get up here and say ""follow your dreams""
0:40
as if this is a meritocracy, it is not, ok? I had a privileged life and I got lucky and I'm unhappy.
0:46
[Audience laughs] [Wreden] Please, help me. Please give me some of whatever it is that-that makes you complete, I want- whatever that wholeness is
0:54
that you just summoned out of nothing and you put into your work, you were...complete in some way that I never was!
1:00
I want to know how to be a good person, I want to know how not to hate myself. Please! [Jacksepticeye] It's a hard life, man.
1:07
I-It's not a hard life. It's a-it's a weird life. When there's so many eyeballs on you all at once, and, like,
1:13
everything you say is put under the microscope. Blah blah blah- It's so f***in' weird.
1:22
[Jason Pargin] We were trying to figure out why... PewDiePie had surpassed, y'know, 30 million subscribers.
1:29
And that he had literally THE most-watched show in all of media. And I think when we had this conversation,
1:34
South Park had just done an episode about how... ...mystifying that was. [Kyle] ""You're watching someone play Call of Duty and talk about it?""
1:41
[Ike] *claps* ""PewDiePie!"" This is what kids consider entertainment is this guy shouting at video games,
1:48
or- or, whatever. Or like, that didn't make sense to me. so I had made it a point since then to try to-
1:54
because it is kind of my job to stay current on things a little bit even though I'm hopelessly old, and what I had found was
2:02
that a huge segment of the entertainment that's out there among the popular youtubers, it really is just people hanging out
2:11
and having someone to hang out with. And they will just sit together and watch a movie or something
2:19
and you're only watching it because you kind of get to, like, just be friends with them in the room?
2:25
Only, you don't have to say anything? [Jacksepticeye] 'What do you like most about what you do?' Honestly, as cliché as it is to say... THIS kind of stuff.
2:32
It's-it's the community aspect of what I do that's the most fun part of it all, interacting with the people who watch your content.
2:39
[Bo Burnham] I think, like, the poison of-of...now is fan interaction.
2:44
[Jack] You can be an actor and you can make a movie, but there's so much time between when you start that project-
2:49
when you get the role in that project- to when it's actually out and you can interact with people about it, compared to what YouTube is, whereas I record this video now,
2:57
it's probably gonna go up tomorrow, and I get direct feedback from you always, all the time. [Alton Brown] Yeah, somebody like started an account
3:04
saying that they were...my...spouse, and I was kind of like ""you people are all creeps."" [Jack] It can be a bit overloading sometimes,
3:11
and some people from traditional media might think that that's a bad thing because it's too much- it's too much stimulus all the time.
3:17
[Markiplier] Did you know that there's a whole fan base dedicated to like my arms and my pit hair? [Jack] I love it!
3:22
[Boogie2988] I get to the big concert hall and I roll right through the front doors, and Mark being the smart person he is and aware of what's going on,
3:30
I believe he ends up nopeing out. I think he tries to go find, uh, backstage, but John and-and Jack follow me on in
3:38
and immediately Jack is swarmed. [Bo] -artists that just, cave to their fans and do all this stuff for their fans-
3:46
-celebrity, which was like a byproduct of art, it's gone from it. Now, it's just celebrities and people.
3:52
[Jack] I just want to meet you guys all the time. It's the best feeling in the world, it's why I love doing Youtube.
3:57
If you guys weren't there to meet, then... i-it just wouldn't be worthwhile to me because you guys means so much to me.
4:02
[Boogie] But I didn't even know there was this many people at the concert, I don't think there was, but he is literally swarmed by ten,
4:07
then twenty, then fifty, then a hundred...teenage girls, it is like Beatlemania, they are clawing all over him to get a hold of him,
4:15
and they're like taking pictures with him, they're trying to touch him... [Bo] I try not to think about...fans.
4:21
♫ A part of me loves you ♫ [Jack] I wouldn't do this if you weren't there watching,
4:26
and I really love you guys to bits- ♫ Part of me hates you ♫ [Jack] Sincerely-
4:31
♫ Part of me needs you ♫ ♫ Part of me fears you ♫
4:36
[Boogie] We get to the green room and I expect Jack to be livid with me or at least livid with the situation, and he's not mad at all,
4:42
but he is exasperated and I'll never forget he says something to the effect of, ""Boogie, I'd love to meet every girl there, I'd love to meet every girl in the world,
4:49
but I can't do it. There's only one me, there's thousands of them. They all want to meet me and I can't do it, I can't take a picture with every girl here
4:56
there's-there's thousands of girls here. [Mike Stoklasa] The relationship between Follower and Instagrammer and the-
5:02
[Jay Bauman] -The psychology of how that can affect you, like on both sides. [Jack] I respect your guy's opinions a great deal, and I listen to you
5:09
every single day from the stuff I'm doing, and I try my best to do right by you guys, and I hope I'm doing you guys proud.
5:15
[Bo] I feel like the best thing I can give people is what I believe I should do, regardless of what they think.
5:21
[Jack] I love you, I've-I've seen people say ""I don't know if he cares about us anymore"", but... hopefully any of you who are there over the weekend can tell that I really do.
5:29
[Bo] ...videos of them opening up gifts from their fans and talking about it, I'm like ""Why are-where the f*** are... what the f*** is happening?""
5:35
♫ The truth is, my biggest problem's you ♫ ♫ I want to please you ♫
5:40
♫ But I want to stay true to myself ♫ ♫ I want to give you the night out that you deserve ♫ [Jack] ...I'm having the time of my life doing this stuff, and I never want anything
5:49
to change too much. I want to still do it for fun, I want to still be... I want to still feel like a friend to all you guys.
5:56
♫ But I want to say what I think and not care what you think about it ♫ [Tsundere Chan] You mean how I could never want to be
6:01
with a pitiful human like yourself, wasting away playing games and watching anime, probably never going to amount to anything in the rest of your sad, pathetic life?
6:09
[Jessi] She's supposed to just stay stationary for this half-hour, while this fake imaginary boyfriend
6:16
talks to her and compliments her and makes her feel good about herself, and then she goes one more day without killing herself.
6:22
[Gigguk] Alright? That was-That was mean. [Shane Dawson] For me, what I do is when I'm gonna eat dinner, alone,
6:27
*laughs* um, with my dog, in my creepy house, I like to turn on a video of somebody eating food and talking,
6:33
and it kind of makes you feel like you're eating dinner with somebody. That is so f***ing sad when I say it out loud, holy s***.
6:39
[Kendrick Lamar] I never thought that a female will cry for me, right? *laughs* I always thought that was the most insane thing
6:45
when I look on TVs and they be crying, you know, you know, for... Justin Bieber, Usher, and stuff like that, right?
6:51
That happened. Six young ladies running to me. Boom, rush me. All got tears in the eyes at the same time.
6:58
So I'm tripping to myself, ""What happened, did one of my- something happened to my peoples?"" It's like, ""No, we love Section.80 so much,
7:05
we was just talking about it and we all just broke down in tears and we see you and we thought it was just meant to be to see you,
7:11
since we were talking about it."" I was like ""Woah. That's crazy."" I couldn't believe it. [J.T. Sexkik] ""-it's about real happiness that you can't get with 3d""...?
7:20
[Jay] ...it's the first movie I've seen that really captures the kind of psychology of like a parasocial relationship, which is that one-sided relationship
7:27
where you-you follow someone on Instagram or Twitter or whatever and you feel like they're your friend even though they don't know you f***ing exist.
7:34
Um...it's a scary scary world when it comes to that stuff. [Waifubot] If you had the option to truly dive into your fantasy,
7:42
a perfect world to escape your reality, would you say no? Of course, you never really wanted us to be real.
7:50
[Bo] They're lying too, that's all. They're lying. Entertainers, they are lying and they are manipulating you,
7:56
and it's not in the good way. It's like advertising, you deserve better. I'm not saying I'm it, but I'm the guy that says you deserve better,
8:02
you go get better, you say ""Thank you weird man. Bye."" *Audience laughs*
8:08
Anyone watch, uh, celebrity lip-syncing on The Tonight Show, you know? *Audience cheers* -It's the end of culture.
8:13
Culture's over everybody, we lost. *Audience claps* This is entertainment.
8:19
How is this entertainment? People we've seen too much of mouthing along to songs we've heard too much of,
8:25
and this is the bread and butter of American television, and it's always one of two things, on celebrity lip-syncing, it's either a male celebrity lip-syncing to a woman song,
8:33
*laughs* but he's not- *Audience laughs* -Or, it's... a rich, young, white actress ironically lip-syncing to a hip-hop song.
8:42
Ho hoo. ♫ Fuck the police coming straight from the underground. ♫ ♫ Can you believe this song was once an honest articulation of class struggle?
8:50
Uh huh ha! F*** these people, how dare they think that them f***ing around is worthy of your attention.
8:56
Them playing pictionary- your attention's a valuable thing. I worked for three years to... get it for an hour, and I barely get there.
9:03
-See? *Audience laughs* It's like, you know these people actually do a job, right? They actually are supposed to give you a tangible service.
9:11
You know, beyond just you liking them, like they're actually supposed to give you something concrete that you can- that can affect you or you can pass along
9:21
or will mean something to you or-or will stay with you, and it has become this like IV drip, this just constant...distraction or, um...
9:33
yeah. [Jack] If I didn't have you here, I'd fall apart. I wouldn't know what to make, I wouldn't know what I was doing was right.
9:40
I need that validation, like the game was saying. [Michael B. Jordan] Uh, it makes me run the other way.
9:45
*exhales* Like a flock of fans, you know I'm saying, like big groups that swarm on you a little bit so gotta kinda like gauge it
9:51
like ""Is this dangerous? Can this get out of hand?"" and then once you make that quick decision, I'm-I'm out of there.
9:57
-Out of there? -Yeah, yeah. [Boogie] ...and if I didn't already love Jack, I would love Jack there because he wasn't worried about himself, he wasn't worried about the mistake I made,
10:05
he was worried-he was worried about disappointing his fans, and that's-I mean, that's a true Youtuber, you gotta love somebody who feels like that.
10:13
[Shannon] An honorific is “a title or word implying or expressing high status, politeness, or respect”.
10:19
You probably know the Japanese honorific “-san”, which is similar to “Mr. or “Mrs.” in English and communicates respect,
10:25
whereas “-kun” is “used by persons of senior status in addressing or referring to those of junior status, or by anyone when addressing or referring
10:33
to male children or male teenagers.” Grape-kun was a humboldt penguin at the Tobu Zoo in Japan,
10:38
named for the purple identification band strapped to his wing. Grape-kun had a mate named Midori who, after he had to leave the enclosure
10:45
for a period of time due to health problems, left him for a male penguin who was younger than him. Humboldt penguins typically mate for life and Grape-kun, as you can imagine,
10:54
was devastated. That is, until the anime Kemono Friends ran a promotion at Tobu Zoo and Hululu entered Grape-kun’s life.
11:01
To quote a a SoranNews24 article on Grape-kun: ""While the other animals paid no attention to the cardboard cutouts in their midst,
11:07
Grape-kun became so enamoured by his 2-D visitor that he couldn’t tear his eyes away from her, and it wasn’t long before photos began surfacing online, showing the penguin
11:14
staring up at her for hours at a time and refusing to leave her side."" The Daily Mail is hardly a reputable source,
11:20
but they were accurate when describing penguin mating rituals which Grape-kun displayed when trying to court Hululu.
11:26
*Grape-kun caws* ""Grape’s true feelings were all but confirmed when he was observed
11:31
standing before the cut-out with his wings outstretched and his beak pointed up. This stance is a courtship ritual in the penguin world, and an indicator
11:38
that Grape could be ready to take his relationship to the next leVEL."" A Metro article stated that:
11:43
“…it was so all-consuming that he neglected to eat his meals, meaning zookeepers had to remove the cut-out.
11:48
When the cut-out was taken away, Grape-kun began eating again- but it was obvious that he was deeply missing his cardboard soul mate.
11:54
The zoo has since embraced the penguin’s unusual crush by broadcasting updates of the couple on social media.""
12:00
It describes how the Tobu Zoo profited off of the attention Grape-Kun received, saying: “In fact, they’re so in love with the idea of their penguin being in love
12:08
that they’ve even started selling a ‘Loving Grape’ drink in (the) gift shop …describing it to customers as the ‘perfect embodiment’
12:15
of Grape-kun and his cut-out’s relationship. Who doesn’t love a good marketing opportunity?
12:20
The label states that the ‘white and deep purple mix together beautifully, yet the ice cream makes you feel cold’, to remind zoo-goers of ‘two penguin souls
12:28
that yearn to be together but remain in separate dimensions’."" This is all real. This is a real thing that actually...happened.
12:34
After some time Grape-kun fell ill and was dying. In a straitstimes article, Tobu Zoo’s penguin caretaker Eri Nemoto said:
12:42
“We put the cardboard panel next to him to comfort him to the very end.” The goodbye tweet from the zoo to Grape-kun when he died,
12:48
translated into English, reads: “The Humboldt penguin Grape-kun passed away yesterday. Sincere thanks to everyone for supporting him until now.
12:56
Thank you also to Hululu, who watched over him until the very end. And thank you, Grape-kun, for all this time.
13:03
Rest peacefully in heaven.“ From the technology Enquirer: ""Even Kemono Friends manga artist, Mine Yoshizaki,
13:10
drew up a special illustration of Hululu with Grape-kun. In the illustration, they wear matching purple bands
13:15
as if these were wedding rings."" A “waifu” is “a fictional female character from non-live-action visual media
13:22
(typically an anime, manga or video game) to whom one is attracted.” I don’t want to spend too much time getting into waifu culture-
13:28
if you’re interested, in 2012 video essayist JT Sexkik published a video essay called “Waifuism And You” that you can check out.
13:35
Sexkik has a background in chan culture and I don’t agree with some of his language (including slurs) or some of what he says in his essays,
13:41
but I still find value in them and in the research that he does. [J.T.] 'Waifu as a Lifestyle'? What?
13:47
[Shannon] His waifuism essay is an honest examination of the phenomenon from someone who is very familiar with it,
13:52
and the enraged comments he got in response show that he definitely struck a nerve. [J.T.] 'Mai Waifu' was basically... like a joke,
13:59
it was a facetious, tongue-in-cheek way of being like: ""Oh, I like this character or she's really cute or...""
14:04
something like that. What's interesting though is the thing that the word is come to represent now, which is an obsessive commitment to a fictional character.
14:12
This...whole concept... is so baffling to me. [Shannon] Gigguk also made a couple of short films dealing with waifu culture
14:19
called “Your Waifu is Real” and “Your Waifu Doesn’t Love You” that would be further illuminating to the uninitiated.
14:25
[Waifubot] Was I created to research the cure for cancer? Solve world hunger? -Oh, no, we just want you to be the imaginary girlfriend to a bunch of guys.
14:32
[Waifubot] I think I understand. This whole waifu culture, it's like...some self-aware meta joke.
14:38
-Correct, for the most part. -And nobody who really choose to have a waifu if they actually existed.
14:45
Hello? [J.T.] Or there's also the whole '3D Pig Disgusting' thing, which I mean, you know, uh...that is still mostly a joke, but...
14:54
uh... there's still this undercurrent of misogyny among this-this uh... this circle of people.
15:00
[Shannon] Anime nerds into waifu culture related strongly to Grape-kun and responded with an outpouring of support.
15:06
The straitstimes piece phrases it as: “The plight of the romantic penguin went viral, earning Grape millions of fans worldwide.”
15:13
A Soranews24 article on Grape-kun is titled: “Japan’s anime-loving penguin turned to comfort of a 2-D girl
15:19
after being scorned by his 3-D wife”, subtitled “Lost his real-life penguin wife, gained an anime waifu”.
15:24
""Were Grape-kun a human, his situation would have elicited at least a few cries of “He should stop obsessing over anime characters
15:31
and look for a real girl instead!” But it turns out that Grape-kun did indeed have a 3-D romantic partner, and it was only after that relationship fell apart
15:38
that he found comfort with his 2-D crush. Having lost his companion, Grape-kun began spending more time apart
15:44
from the other members of the penguin colony. Then, like a lonely, lovesick otaku taking refuge in anime indulgence,
15:51
he became enthralled with Hululu once a cardboard standee of the character was placed near the penguin habitat as part of a cross-promotion with Kemono Friends.""
15:58
A Vice piece titled 'Love Is Dead, and So Is the Penguin Who Fell for a Cardboard Cutout', states:
16:04
""Fans of Grape seem to be taking his death pretty seriously, referring to him as a person, imagining his service as a soldier’s funeral,
16:10
even starting a Change.org petition begging the zoo to erect a statue of Grape and Hululu in his honor."" The piece ends with: ""So long, Grape-kun.
16:17
May we all find someone who looks at us the way you looked at that cardboard cutout."" From the BBC: ""Sadly, his death comes a month before the zoo’s Grape Festival,
16:25
a series of events spanning two weeks based around the celebrity penguin."" Grape-kun didn’t know what an anime is and didn’t understand marketing or branding
16:33
or currency, but the Tobu Zoo sure knew how to make money off of him and off of his story.
16:38
Welcome to part two of Fake Friends, my series on parasocial relationships. Part one is an introduction to the term
16:44
and an explanation of the concept and its academic background, so you should check that video out before you watch this one.
16:50
This episode is a broad exploration of different examples of parasocial relationships. I also want to give the same disclaimer from the first essay that a discussion
16:58
of a media figure or content creator in this essay because they're a relevant example does not mean that I endorse them or their work or their beliefs.
17:05
Some people I talk about I know are awful and for others I don’t pretend to know that much about them or their field, so blanket content warning
17:11
and viewer discretion advised for anything that I mention in this essay. I used a lot of fairly obvious examples of parasocial relationships in the first video-
17:18
Mister Rogers, Dora the Explorer, let’s players like Markiplier, Bob Ross, etcetera. I did also intentionally focus on what I consider to be the creepy
17:26
and exploitative nature of a lot of parasocial relationships, but not every instance of a parasocial relationship,
17:32
even one that's deliberately fostered and profited off of, is inherently evil. Harp seals, also known as Saddleback seals, are born yellow-white
17:39
before their coats turn white, then grey. They're goofy and adorable, especially as pups with big black eyes against the white fur and snow,
17:46
So, when Takanori Shibata of the Intelligent System Research Institute of Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology
17:53
was designing a therapeutic robot, he chose harp seals as a basis for his design. Paro is a robot alternative to animal assisted therapy,
18:00
a simulated therapy animal who never needs to be fed or cleaned up after and who won't ever get sick or die.
18:05
I talked about Paro in my uncanny valley essay, a companion essay to this series that deals with inhuman objects that try to pass himself off as human and our relationship with them.
18:14
Check it out if you want further elaboration. here's an excerpt from Adam Peoria's popular science piece titled: 'Will Your Next Best Friend Be A Robot?'
18:21
""To make Paro realistic, Shibata flew out to a floating ice field in north-east Canada to record real baby seals in their natural habitat.
18:28
In addition to replicating those sounds in the robot, he designed it to seek out eye contact, respond to touch, cuddle, remember faces,
18:35
and learn actions that generate a favorable reaction. [Takanori, Subtitles] PARO has a value system
18:40
that includes enjoying being stroked and disliking being hit. In its relationship with its owner, PARO remembers if it's been stroked.
18:49
And in similar situations, this robot acts in ways that make it more likely to be stroked.
18:55
In this way, PARO gradually learns to develop a personality that its owner likes.
19:00
[Shannon] ""Just like animals used in pet therapy, Shibata argues, Paro can help relieve depression and anxiety-
19:05
but it never needs to be fed and doesn't die."" In 'It's Not a Stuffed Animal, It's a $6,000 Medical Device;
19:11
Paro the Robo Seal Aims to Comfort Elderly, but Is It Ethical?' by Anne Tergesen and Miho Inada, published in the Wall Street Journal,
19:17
they quote Sherry Turkle, a professor in the Science, Technology and Society program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
19:24
saying that she acknowledges Paro’s potential as a “communication aid”, but warns against regarding it as a companion.
19:29
“Why are we so willing to provide our parents, then ourselves, with faux relationships?” she asks.
19:35
To further quote the piece- ""Shibata says he designed Paro to evoke memories of pets and babies.
19:40
It weighs about 6 pounds, feels warm and sucks on a pacifier-like charger. ""It doesn't do much other than utter weird sounds like 'heee' or 'huuu,'""
19:50
says Tomoko Iimura, whose adult day-care center in Tsukuba City keeps its Paro in a closet.""
19:55
Paro's European distributor is the Danish Technological Institute. Denmark's Paros are mostly purchased with public funds.
20:02
The DTI, quote, ""requires caregivers to attend Paro seminars, where they discuss such issues as whether it’s OK to leave an elderly person alone
20:09
with a Paro, and whether patients must be told it’s a robot. Don’t allow someone to “escape into a strange seal robot’s universe,”
20:16
cautions Lone Gaedt, senior consultant at DTI."" Vincentian Collaborative, which runs several homes,
20:21
""has made Paro one of the many formal “interventions” used before staff medicate dementia patients who become very agitated or aggressive.""
20:28
[Takanori, Subtitles] Previously, such patients were sedated, and even now, that's sometimes done in Europe and America.
20:34
In Japan, such patients are sometimes physically restrained. But if such patients have contact with PARO,
20:41
they settle down almost immediately, smile, and feel good.
20:47
Sometimes they're able to talk. As such effects can be actually observed, there's no need to use drugs.
20:55
Of course, this method doesn't work in 100% of cases. But even if it doesn't work, it has no particular side-effects,
21:01
so all you need to do is stop using it. [Shannon] ""Aides also take Paro to residents’ rooms to get them to socialize.
21:07
At another Vincentian home, Lois Simmeth, 73, doesn’t always participate in group activities, but she ventures into the hall when she hears Paro’s sounds.
21:14
""I love animals,"" explains Ms. Simmeth. She whispered to the robot in her lap: ""I know you're not real,
21:20
but somehow, I don't know, I love you."""" The Popular Science piece describes Paro in positive terms-
21:27
""Yasuko Komatsu, the head nurse, pulls me aside to tell me a story: Not long ago, a patient arrived who would frequently wander the hallways,
21:34
entering others’ rooms to move and collect interesting objects. One of her favorite targets was the room of a patient
21:39
who compulsively arranged her belongings in a precise order. The thefts led to bedlam. “The victim would raise her voice yelling and screaming,” Komatsu says.
21:48
“But the other patient didn’t really understand why she was so mad. The staff tried to intervene. But the problems continued,
21:53
and the screaming upset the other patients.” Paro’s arrival had a calming effect on all the patients, but especially the wanderer.
21:59
She largely abandoned her forays when told the baby seal was waiting for her in the third-floor common room. During my visit, I see this patient humming to Paro and gently brushing its hair.
22:08
She notices me watching and summons me over. “Paro is saying, ‘Nice to meet you,’ ” she says. Then she smiles serenely and returns to her robot.""
22:16
Pepper is a robot developed by SoftBank Robotics. Softbank Promotional material states: ""Pleasant and likeable,
22:22
Pepper is much more than a robot, he is a genuine humanoid companion created to communicate with you
22:27
in the most natural and intuitive way, through his body movements and his voice."" [Advertisement] Pepper's not here to replace humans or even vacuum the floor.
22:36
Pepper is here to make people happy, help them grow, and enhance their lives.
22:41
[Shannon] Pepper has been used both to increase foot traffic in stores and to manipulate consumers into giving over their contact information.
22:48
[Ad] Pepper can be incredibly helpful interacting with customers and solving problems, or providing information.
22:54
That's because Pepper is a friend, an advisor, and a business partner. [Shannon] In 2017 Thuy Ong published a piece in The Verge called
23:01
'Pepper the robot is now a Buddhist priest programmed to chant at funerals'. ""While the intention may be good, the execution is not so.
23:09
Judging from footage of the chants, the robot is quite disconcerting and brazen. Buddhist temples are places of peace and reflection.
23:16
Death, and therefore funerals, are of religious significance and Buddhist priests play a vital role in the ceremony.
23:23
Personally, I can't see this working out, in addition to it being just plain creepy. When I sent this to my mom, she responded with a cry-face emoji.""
23:31
In a reuters piece, ""Buddhist priest Tetsugi Matsuo said he came to the expo to see if Pepper could “impart the ‘heart’ aspect to a machine
23:38
because he believes that the ‘heart’ is the foundation of religion."" The robot has not yet been hired for a funeral.""
23:44
From the Popular Science piece- ""Since Pepper has limited computational abilities, engineers designed the robot
23:50
to more closely resemble a child than an adult. “You can find kids who cannot understand everything adults are talking about,”
23:56
Hayashi says, “but a kid wants to make the adults around him happy. And he talks a lot because he knows that’s the best way for him to [do that]
24:02
when he doesn’t have the same mental capacity as adults. It’s the same with Pepper.” All of these tricks ultimately serve the same goal:
24:09
They subtly convey that this little guy wants to hang out with me - — that he is a friend, an ally.
24:14
“The important thing,” Hayashi says, “is the sense of being accepted, the sense of being understood by Pepper, and the feeling
24:21
that he is reacting based on that understanding.” That illusion of understanding, what some might call artificial empathy,
24:27
touches an “evolutionary button” roboticists are attempting to exploit. Some robots push it without even trying.
24:33
Fostering a relationship between man and machine may require far less sophistication than what even Pepper has to offer.
24:39
It’s not clear that robots need to look human at all. Matthias Scheutz, who heads the Tufts University Human-Robot Interaction Laboratory,
24:46
notes that there is already literature on people developing feelings — what he calls “unidirectional bonds” — for their Roomba vacuum cleaners.
24:53
“People seem to experience gratitude toward their Roomba,” he says. “They think it works hard and that it should take a break.
24:59
They clean for it. They take it on vacation. It seems totally absurd. The Roomba doesn’t even look like a person,
25:05
but it does something nice for us, and since it moves, it can seem like an autonomous agent.” Social robotics pioneer Cynthia Breazeal, who directs MIT’s Personal Robots Group,
25:14
notes that the company IRobot has encountered a similar reaction from battle-hardened vets begging for technicians
25:20
to fix their bomb-disposal robots. “They have soldiers coming back in tears saying, ‘Please fix my robot Scooby Doo,
25:26
because it saved my life,’ ” she says. “I mean these are powerful emotional attachments. And this is a completely teleoperated bomb disposal robot
25:34
that wasn’t even trying to be social. It’s just part of the human experience and how we relate and engage with one another and the world. We are profoundly social beings.”
25:42
Such an attachment is troubling to some. Sherry Turkle, the director of MIT’s Initiative on Technology and the Self,
25:48
argues that what robots provide is the illusion of a relationship. And she worries that some who find human relationships challenging
25:54
may turn to robots for companionship instead. Tuft’s Scheutz warns that elderly people who feel depressed
26:00
could become more so if they misunderstand a robot’s actions, or if the robot fails to correctly read human signals.
26:06
“There are just so many ways these interactions can go wrong,” Scheutz says."" We’re pretty used to subservient female companions-
26:13
Cortana, Alexa, Siri- and the creepy implications of these assistants are self-evident-
26:20
but GateBox is the peak of uncomfortable simulated female companionship. From Newsweek’s 'HOLOGRAPHIC WIFE OFFERS INTIMACY TO JAPAN’S CELIBATE GENERATION'-
26:29
""To fill this intimacy void, a Japanese firm has come up with a holographic companion that allows its owner to
26:34
“enjoy a life with someone while still retaining your freedom.”"" To quote from the virtualtrends piece 'A holographic virtual girlfriend lives inside Japan’s answer to the Amazon Echo'-
26:43
""Instead of a simple, cylindrical speaker design, Gatebox has a screen and a projector, which brings Hikari —
26:49
her name, appropriately, means “light” — to life inside the gadget. On the outside are microphones, cameras, and sensors
26:55
to detect temperature and motion, so she can interact with you on a more personal level, rather than being a voice on your phone.""
27:01
Vinclu apparently is planning multiple possible personalities for Gatebox — which, as part of the device’s backstory, is a gateway
27:08
to the dimension the character lives in. As a side note, most of Hikari’s personality seems to involve her wanting to please her “master”.
27:15
And also, uh...cooking eggs? Eggs?? Her coming from another dimension reminds me
27:20
of how Hululu’s relationship with Grape-Kun was described. *Grape-kun caws* I found a 2007 Washington Post piece describing how two English security guards
27:30
were so distracted by the game Virtual Woman that they missed the fact that their bank was being robbed. But when going back for a closer look, I could not find
27:36","it's done!!!!

[Mendelssohn: String Quartet No. 6 in F minor, III. Adagio] [V.O] ""Imagine how a woman feels.""
0:07
“Imagine how soft and warm her skin feels. ""Imagine the sweet smell of her perfume.
0:14
""Imagine her tenderly pressing her soft lips against yours. ""Imagine her letting you get on top of her and insert your [bleep] inside her, softly
0:23
""moaning as it slides in. ""Imagine the walls of her tight, soft, warm [bleep] wrapped around every inch of your [bleep].
0:35
""Imagine her breathing getting heavier with every thrust. ""Imagine her wrapping her arms and legs around you, holding you as close as she possibly
0:44
""can and begging you to [bleep] inside her as you release every ounce of your [bleep]
0:53
""into her. ""Then imagine the feeling of pure satisfaction and peace that comes afterwards, and looking
1:00
""beside you to see a person that cares about you and has accepted you
1:08
""in the most intimate way possible. “You will never get to experience this because your skeleton is too small or the bones in
1:21
""your face are not the proper shape. ""Have a nice day.”
1:27
[Melancholic chill jazz]
1:33
- Hello boys. Let’s talk about bone structure. [Chill music]
1:43
There’s something basically Soviet about the way the Internet names things. Stalin had portmanteaus like ""agitprop"", ""politburo"", and ""kompromat"", and we have ""webinar"", ""podcast"",
1:54
and ""incel"", short for ""involuntary celibate."" The word ""incel"" was invented in the late 90s by a lonely bisexual called Alana, who
2:01
created a website called ""Alana's Involuntary Celibacy Project"" that was essentially a safe space for people who just couldn’t get it in.
2:09
But in our own miserable moment of Internet history, the word “incel” refers to a more specific community of mostly heterosexual men, centered around forums like Incel.me
2:19
and r/braincels. This group has recently gotten a lot of bad press because for the last few years they’ve
2:25
been churning out mass murderers faster than Marvel can make Avengers movies. But most incels aren’t violent killers.
2:30
They’re just men who’ve formed an identity around not getting laid. In this video I don’t want to mock incels or lecture them or even sympathize with them.
2:39
I just want to understand who they are and why they’re like this. To start with, sometimes the best way to understand a person’s world is to learn their language,
2:47
and the language of the incels… well. You’ll see. 1st Base: Incelese
2:55
Does it ever bother you that the word “women” makes adult females sound just a little bit too human?
3:00
Well incels have a solution to that. They’ve taken to calling women ""feeeeeemoooooids.""
3:07
The choice of vocabulary tells us how incels think of women: not as sisters or mothers, and certainly not as autonomous people, but as a kind of foreign, inscrutable object,
3:16
comparable to a natural resource—unobtainium—to which incels believe all men are entitled, and to which they feel they have been unjustly denied.
3:24
There’s a long tradition of nerdy men talking about women in nerdily misogynistic ways. I’m reminded of famed rocket scientist Werner von Braun’s remark about female astronauts:
3:34
[V.O.] “We are reserving 110 pounds of payload for recreational equipment.”
3:41
- Which is not to say that alpha males are less misogynistic than nerds, but simply that the nerds have a nerdy style of misogyny.
3:48
Now “femoid” is about as neutral a term as incels have for women and it’s only downhill from there.
3:54
There’s the usual standbys: ""bitches"", ""sluts"", ""whores"", all conveying a searing resentment
3:59
of female sexuality, the pinnacle of which is represented by the bespoke incel coinage “roastie” which, I’m sorry to inform you, refers to the incel belief that the human
4:08
vulva become mutilated through repeated penetration by different men—though not through repeated
4:13
penetration by the same man interestingly—and thereby come to resemble roast beef. Now by definition, incels haven’t actually observed any vaginas, but to incels anatomy
4:22
is more a matter of metaphysical speculation than crude science. Though, if you ask me the right metaphor for a veteran vag is not roast beef, but sour grapes.
4:33
Of course, not all feeeemooooids are created equal. There are various subspecies:
4:39
- [David Attenborough style V.O.] The Becky, or normie femoid, is to be contrasted with the Stacy, or sexually desirable femoid, whose distinguishing features include “makeup
4:50
on point; Never works a day in her life; Naturally curvy body gives men instant erections; big
4:59
tits and ass show fertility. - Leave my buns alone you savages. The Stacy, naturally, has a male counterpoint, whom incels call the Chad.
5:08
- [David Attenborough style V.O.] A Chad is a hunky alpha, whose hands are always prepared to grab nearby fertile pussy; he has never heard a song in his entire life;
5:20
he has a sloped forehead with a strong brow, ram bow chin, strong jawline, flat occipital plate.
5:29
- It must needs be remarked that the skull of the Chad exhibiteth a brow ridge most pronounced
5:35
whereas the skull of the virgin is most inadequate in this regard, predisposing such specimens
5:43
to an abject existence of lamentation and cuckoldry. - It’s time to talk about bone structure.
5:50
According to a classic incel meme, - [David Attenborough style V.O.] “The difference between Chad and non-Chad is literally
5:56
""a few millimeters of bone.” - I would like to propose a sociological theory.
6:02
Foppington’s law: Once bigotry or self-loathing permeate a given community, it is only a matter
6:07
of time before deep metaphysical significance is assigned to the shape of human skulls.
6:13
Why skulls, you ask. Well, the best explanation I can come up with is that a skull is inanimate and unchangeable.
6:21
It’s therefore the perfect symbol of the intrinsic and permanent characteristics that bigots like to assign to certain groups of people.
6:28
If you believe for example that a certain race or gender is intellectually inferior, you can justify your belief by pointing to the shape a skull and saying, ""Well, that’s
6:39
the reason why, it’s just nature, there’s nothing that can be done about it."" And that is exactly the way incels think about love and celibacy.
6:47
Mankind is divided into two groups of people, the Chads with the fuckable skulls and the incels whose bones come up a few millimeters short.
6:56
Corndog, anyone? I’m really hungry. Of course, it’s not just the skulls the incels blame for their sexlessness.
7:03
They have a whole dictionary of jargon explaining the causes of involuntary celibacy. Heightcels are incel due to their inferior stature.
7:10
Whereas mentalcels can’t attract women because of mental illness or autism, or they’re addicts and then called drugcels.
7:17
Wristcels, on the other hand, are doomed by their overly delicate wrists. Now, obsessing about your wrist size does seem a little weird.
7:25
- [V.O.] “Oh yeah?"" ""Is it a little weird that the average dildo has more girth than my wrist?
7:31
""Is it weird at all that some men have thicker dicks than my wrist? ""But yeah, obviously ‘obsessing’ about my tiny wrists that are smaller than even
7:39
""many women’s is completely irrational body dysmorphia and the reason why no woman wants
7:44
""to be with me or even talk to me is my shitty personality even though literal 80 IQ men ""who have nothing to talk about except who won the game last night are still able to
7:54
""attract a loving partner.” - ...Interesting. A significant number of incels are not white, in which case their unfuckability is attributed
8:03
to race, and they are accordingly termed, apologies in advance, blackcels, ricecels,
8:09
currycels, and so on. Which is not to say all non-white men are celibate. There are of course the occasional Chads of color, with their superior skulls and towering
8:19
stature, whom the incels have christened Tyrones, Changs, and Chadpreets.
8:24
I’m so sorry. So you can be incel because of your looks, your height, your mind, or your race, but
8:30
what unites them all is the conviction that love and sex are forever out of reach. Unless of course you delusionally imagine that you can “ascend,” that is, escape
8:39
your inceldom. If you falsely and pathetically believe that there is any possibility of improvement, well,
8:45
that makes you the lowest of the low, a sad and sorry hopecel.
8:51
Second base: The Red Pill So we have the building blocks of the incel worldview: the Stacys, the Chads, the incels,
8:58
and the normies. From these elements, incels have constructed a theory of human nature and of sexuality,
9:05
which they call the Red Pill. Incels share the Red Pill worldview with the rest of the manosphere, that is, pick-up artists,
9:12
men’s rights activists, and the voluntary celibate community known as Men Going Their Own Way, abbreviated MGTOW.
9:18
According to Red Pill theory, women are by nature hypergamous. Hypergamy, new Greek for marrying above, refers to the practice of seeking relationships with
9:27
men above one’s social status, and also, in incel usage, above one’s attractiveness.
9:32
According to incels, physical attractiveness is naturally distributed equally between the sexes.
9:38
So, if you were to assign numerical ratings to attractiveness, as incels like to do, there would be about as many say 8/10 women as 8/10 men.
9:47
Incels believe that in a just world, a 5/10 man would naturally wind up in a relationship
9:52
with his looksmatch, that is, a 5/10 woman, equivalently attractive to himself.
9:58
But sadly, this just system has been ruined by hypergamous women, who, regardless of their
10:04
own attractiveness, are only interested in dating Chad. Incels sometimes call this the 80/20 rule, the idea that only the top 20% of men will
10:12
ever be desired by women. Now since most heterosexual men do end up in relationships with women, you might be
10:18
raising your eyebrow at that idea. But incels have an explanation. According to the Red Pill theory, women often pursue a mating strategy called ""Alpha Fux
10:27
Beta Bux."" This means that in her 20s a woman will, as incels say, ride the cock carousel, sleeping
10:33
with as many Chads as possible. But as she ages into her 30s she will settle down with a beta normie, whom she’s not
10:39
really attracted to, but whom she will use for financial support, all the while continuously cuckolding him on the alpha cock carousel, before inevitably abandoning him, taking him
10:49
for everything he’s worth in a divorce settlement, and running off to the Mediterranean with all the children and a new Chad boyfriend, while the beta cuck is left behind to fester
10:56
in alimony payments, solitude, and poverty. So the upshot of the Red Pill theory is that for men, there are three possible outcomes.
11:03
Either you’re an incel, doomed to a lifetime of excruciating loneliness and resentment, or you’re a normie, destined to wind up in a sexless marriage with an unfaithful wife,
11:12
who will divorce you, win custody of the children and run off will all your money. Or you could be an alpha—an independent, promiscuous man who sleeps with lots of women
11:22
and forms attachments to none of them. In the Red Pill philosophy there are two ways to become alpha.
11:27
The first is simply to be a Chad by nature. The second is to become a pick-up artist.
11:32
Redpilled pick-up artists believe basically the same things about women that incels believe, that they are hypergamous, duplicitous, and fuckable, but not lovable.
11:42
The difference is that pick-up artists are not celibate, in fact they try to have sex with as many women as possible by following a series of strategies and scripts known as
11:50
“game” as described by the book of that title, as well as by the red-pilled pick-up artist Roosh V, author of a book called—
11:57
Bang, a new mascara from Benefit. So the tube is bomb, I am living.
12:03
Let’s see what kind of wand it has. Oh...it’s so big.
12:08
I wonder what Roosh is up to lately. - I bake my own bread. Yes, I’m outing myself as a baker, as someone who likes to cook.
12:16
I’m not a woman. I am ultra masculine, as you can see, but baking and cooking in general is a scientific thing.
12:23
And men like scientific things. I used to be a scientist. - Well, Roosh you know what?
12:28
If it means you leave women alone then I hope you enjoy your new life as an ultra-masculine baker—
12:34
sorry, I mean bread scientist. So remember the red pill is the realization that women are hypergamous by nature, 20%
12:41
or less of men are really attractive to women, dating is a sexual marketplace, and feminism is a pretext for enabling women to behave however they want while consigning men to
12:50
emasculation and impotence. The black pill is the additional realization that one’s place in the sexual marketplace
12:56
is genetically determined, that one is a permanent virgin, that sex and relationships are forever out of reach, and hence that happiness is impossible and there’s nothing one can do
13:04
except Lie Down and Rot. The black pill is, essentially, dogmatic hopelessness about dating and about life in general.
13:11
It is the pinnacle of what psychotherapists call catastrophizing: a cognitive distortion
13:17
where anxiety or depression leads you to infer apocalyptic conclusions from mundane setbacks
13:22
and anxieties. For instance, a catastrophizing person might begin with the thought, oh no, I’m going to be late for work, and from there infer: my boss is going to be angry, I’m going
13:30
to lose my job, I’m not going to able to get another job, I’m going to be unemployed forever, my family will starve, oh god we’re all going to die.
13:36
Each step in the sequence is sort of plausible, but the leap from step one to step seven is
13:41
completely absurd. This is exactly how the black pill works. You start with experiences of rejection and isolation.
13:47
From there you infer that you are unattractive to women, that you will never be attractive to any woman, that you will be forever alone, that you will always be unhappy, that women
13:54
did this to you, that feminism empowered women to do this to you, that the social trends that made this possible are only getting worse, that humanity itself is doomed and your only
14:02
option is to lie down and rot. Of course, not all incels take things quite so far, but a lot of them do.
14:07
On incel forms suicidal ideation is very common, and posts are often tagged “sui fuel” or “rope fuel” meaning that they make you want to kill yourself, usually because
14:16
they’re reminders of how hopeless the incel situation is, or how devastating it is that incels are missing out on the incredible bliss of sex and romance.
14:23
Now if you suggest to incels that posting sui fuel on forums already populated with lonely and depressed people is maybe not the most responsible idea, they respond that, ""Oh it's
14:33
""just dark humor, it’s just a cope, throw us a bone here."" But a lot of the suicidal stuff shows no signs of humor, and it’s common to see people
14:40
express pretty extreme states of depression, which is not surprising, since hopelessness is the logical conclusion of the black pill worldview.
14:47
One’s possibility for happiness is determined by the genetics of height, frame, and facial bone structure. And if you don’t have these gifts there’s no relief but to cope or rope.
14:56
Now—it’s pretty tempting to just mom the shit out of these kids. You want to grab them by their Black Ops t-shirts, shake them a bit and tell them that there
15:03
are millions of men with small wrists and weak chins getting laid every day, that they’re their own worst enemies, that they need to get off the computer, go outside, make some
15:10
friends, stop hating women, get some hobbies, and who knows maybe then they’ll develop a disposition that women find a little more approachable.
15:17
Essentially, you want to tell them, ""Clean your room, bucko."" In fact for the young men in this demographic who are receptive to that kind of advice,
15:24
Jordan Peterson is probably helpful. Because he’s telling them a lot of what they need to hear, and he’s kind of a sexist
15:29
old man so they might actually listen. But most incels don’t want to hear this kind of advice. In fact, they view it as essentially a microaggression.
15:37
You are, in effect, chadsplaining their oppression to them when you give basic advice like, ""be more confident,"" ""take a shower,"" to people who have already experienced a lifetime of rejection and isolation,
15:48
and who believe they’ve already tried everything. So they despise this kind of advise, and devote endless posts to bitterly mocking the futility
15:55
and insensitivity of it. - [V.O.] “Just go out to parties, bro!” “Instead of hating on women all day why don’t you losers just try being confident
16:03
""like this average looking guy? ""Confidence is key.” “You incels need some hobbies. ""Try reading some books, women love INTELLIGENCE!
16:10
""It works for me bro!” “Aw, you just need to get out more.” ♪ No one knows what it’s like to be hated ♪
16:19
- To incels, their worldview seems ironclad. It has built-in defenses against anyone who would try to change their minds.
16:25
So if you want to understand incels, and in particular if you want to understand why their community produces so many mass murderers, you have to understand that the black pill
16:34
is more than the dogma that you can’t get laid. It’s also the dogma that because you can’t get laid, you can never be happy.
16:41
So what we have on our hands here is more than a bunch of angry Internet misogynists. It’s, at worst, a kind of a death cult, complete with an eternal hell and an omnipotent enemy.
16:52
And it’s not surprising that that state of mind leads a few of them to conclude that since triumph is impossible, why not try revenge?
17:00
Third Base: Tinder is Garbage I know I said I wasn’t gonna sympathize with incels, and I know they don’t want
17:07
my sympathy anyway, and I know it's bad praxis to sympathize with the devil— but on some level I can’t help it.
17:14
The Internet is for introverts, so I’m sure a lot of people watching this feel the same way. I bet some of you have been this guy.
17:20
I’ve been this guy. So look, I’m gonna tell you something I’ve never really come out about on this channel,
17:25
so this is like a really vulnerable moment for me, but I used to live as a man.
17:31
And I’m not proud of that but I’m ready to move on if you’re ready to forgive. I’m in the unusual situation of being a woman who dates men who used to be
17:40
a man who dates women. What kind of fucked up shit is that? Is that even allowed? Alright calm down lesbian stans I’m still attracted to women, and those who lieth betwixt,
17:50
cats, the inherent eroticism of the sea. [Mendelssohn, Hebrides Overture] [V.O] Mmmm yeah.
17:56
Don’t you just wanna get in there. Take me mommy! But I have been on a heterosexual kick lately.
18:03
- I gotta get my hetero on! - What I’m getting at is I’ve used Tinder both as a man seeking women, and as a woman
18:09
seeking men. And I think I that gives me some relevant experiences. When you’re a man the strategy is you’ve gotta send a lot of messages because women
18:17
get a lot of messages, and then you’ve just gotta try to be less of an ogre than the other fuckboys.
18:22
Whereas if you’re a woman, you get to lie recumbent on your chaise longue
18:28
and receive the inquiries. Let’s see how we’re doing here. How many men have liked me on Tinder?
18:34
I’m paying $30 for this information so this better be good. I have 2500 likes.
18:40
That’s a lot of Baltimorean men who swiped right on a tran. What a divine city!
18:45
[Game show music] Awww that’s so nice of them to be interested in me.
18:52
Let’s see what kind of messages I got. ""DICK OR NO DICK?"" ""PRE-OP OR POST-OP?""
18:58
""DID YOU CUT YOUR DICK OFF?"" Oh my god. I’m gonna cut it off, okay? Jesus.
19:04
I will let you smash my pussy so so hard, if you just be patient. it’s a whole process.
19:11
- That’s not a pussy, that’s a fuck hole. You’ll never know what it means to squeeze life out of your sacred passage.
19:17
- Well, that’s true. I’m not squeezing any life out unless something goes very seriously wrong.
19:23
And I assure you that none of the passages I have down there ever have been or ever will be sacred. Abigail, leave my fuck hole out of this.
19:32
When I first started using this app I was messaging a guy who seemed super chill, he was gonna take me to a concert, and I was like that seems like a lot for a first date
19:39
but okay I’ll try it. 15 minutes after we agreed to that he sends me a message.
19:44
“What color panties are you wearing? ""I would love to smell them.”
19:52
...Can we get coffee first? The hell of it is, I probably would’ve let him smell my panties. But this is a thing you bring up on the third fuck.
20:00
You don’t open with panty sniffing. Like the only point of in-app messaging is for me to figure out if you’re gonna murder me, and you’re already fucking it up.
20:06
So this is the experience of women on Tinder. We’re drowning in dick and most of it is terrible.
20:12
Not all, I do have some very sweet messages, and I haven’t used this app in a couple months, so if I didn’t respond to you or if we didn’t match, it’s not because I rejected you,
20:22
it's because I don't like the app. People screenshot my profile and post it online, and they call me contrapoints in app, like—
20:28
I’m just too famous for this shit. My life is hard. So girls, we do a lot of complaining about the firing squad of bad dicks that’s constantly
20:37
pointed at us on dating apps. But how would you feel if instead of that you were just getting radio silence like the incels get?
20:45
I can’t speak for other women, but personally, I prefer the firing squad of dicks.
20:50
You know, at least these pricks care enough about my pussy to be an asshole about my dick.
20:55
I feel sorry for men on dating apps I really do. They have to deal with a lot of rejection, and that must be difficult.
21:00
And these apps are especially brutal to people who aren’t photogenic. If you’re meeting people at a bar or a party, you might strike up a conversation with someone
21:07
you’re not initially physically attracted to. But then maybe they’re super funny, or charming, or maybe they’re attracted to me—and
21:14
that’s an attractive quality in another person that they appreciate how beautiful I am.
21:19
But on Tinder, you’re just browsing a catalog of faces, and gatekeeping who even gets to talk to you in the first place.
21:25
Red-pillers have a really gross way of talking about dating in terms of “sexual market value” but like, dating kind of is a marketplace, or at least you can analyze it like one.
21:35
And our culture is so visual, and these apps are so picture-centered that bone structure,
21:41
like, it’s not the only thing that matters, but it matters a great deal. And this is where I do have sympathy for the incels, because as a trans woman I know what
21:49
it’s like to obsess over millimeters of bone. I had to interrupt work on this video to go to a consultation for facial feminization
21:56
surgery so that I can going to pay luxury car amounts of money to shave off a few millimeters of bone here and there because it must needs be remarked that the skull of the female exhibiteth
22:06
a brow ridge less pronounced. I mean I’m just as obsessed with bone structure as the goddamn incels, because I think certain
22:12
parts of my face make me look like a man, and I worry about it every day. We’re all obsessed with the bones honey.
22:18
We all have bones inside us, we all love touching bones. [sensual whispering V.O.] You want to take a measurement from the supraorbital ridge to
22:26
the lambdoid suture, and multiply that figure by pi to calculate what we call the Chad circumference.
22:35
Why is no one talking about the Chad circumference? 4th base: Just the tip
22:41
There’s another way I think my experience as a trans woman is relevant to the incel discussion, and that’s that I know delusional self-loathing when I see it.
22:50
I’m far from the first to point out that the “supreme gentleman” incel mass murderer Eliot Rodger was, apart from his narcissistic psychopath personality, an eminently bangable twink.
23:00
Now I’m not gonna show you pictures of incels, but on their forums they do sometimes post selfie threads.
23:06
And you can’t say this on incel forums without enraging them, but in confidence from one
23:11
pretend clinician to another, let me tell you that the truth about incels is that almost
23:17
all of them are completely normal looking guys. But of course that’s not the feedback they get from other incels.
23:23
The feedback they get is that their chins are weak, their hair is thin, their skin is garbage and there’s no hope whatsoever, no woman will ever love them, they are truecels
23:31
with no option but to lie down and rot. And the interesting thing is, those guys post selfies to those threads knowing
23:38
that’s the feedback that they’re gonna get. So why? Why do they do it? Well, I’ll tell you a little story.
23:44
There is a website on the Internet called 4chan.org that has a board called LGBT.
23:50
A few years ago this was used mainly by the 25 gay men who actually like Milo Yiannopoulos,
23:55
but recently it’s used mostly by “men” who are entertaining the notion of becoming
24:02
women, and by early transition trans women. So the board is jokingly called TTTT.
24:08
Now I’ve recently moved beyond that first stage of my transition, but the memory is still fresh, and let me tell you, it is a painful, awkward, humiliating stage of life.
24:18
So the trans women of TTTT are tragic, they’re basically still in man mode, which is why
24:24
they’re using 4chan, and I bring them up because they remind me a lot of incels.
24:30
For incels the core frustration is that they can’t get laid. For TTTT it’s that they can’t pass as female.
24:37
Both groups post selfies knowing they’re going to get brutal unconstructive feedback. And both groups have a weird vocabulary with which to express their anxieties.
24:45
For instance on TTTT a major piece of jargon is hon, a slur used by trans women for other
24:52
trans women, which basically means that you look like a man in a dress, which is what every trans woman is afraid of.
24:58
And there’s another commonality with incels too, with all bigots and self-loathers, which if you’ve been paying attention, you’ve already guessed.
25:06
-[V.O] “You will never be seen as a woman because of your head size. ""Have all the surgeries in the world, your massive man noggin will stay the same.”
25:14
“lel, this freak thinks he has very soft facial features. ""His head is fucking huge, lel and the hons on reddit are hugboxing him and telling him
25:23
""that there are women with big heads. ""No, there aren’t. There aren’t fucking women with heads as big as that and ffs won’t change shit.
25:31
""You might as well repress. ""You transition with a man’s head. ""You will be clocked, you will be looked at as a freak, you will never be seen as a legit woman. 100%”
25:39
“THIS is why I am not transitioning. ""Thank you Skull-people for showing me the way and that no matter what I do I will always
25:48
""be a manly man skull-wise. ""You saved me the embarrassment of being a literal big-headed man in a dress.""
25:56
- 'Tis evident the cranial vault of the autogynephile be much more voluminous and the facial plane wider—
26:05
- It always comes back to the skulls. Every time. The other interesting thing about TTTT is I used to get posted there a lot.
26:13
For a while I had some stans on the board who basically viewed me as inspiration.
26:18
Yikes. Because of course that kind of post is frowned upon. If I’m not looked at as a big-skulled manly freak, if my transition is going well,
26:27
that means that some of their transitions might go well too, and that is an unacceptable
26:32
conclusion for a community founded on self-loathing and hopelessness. So it was necessary for the rest of the board to explain why I didn’t
26:40
pass, why I would never pass, and why anyone who looked less good than me shouldn’t even fucking think about it. They shouldn’t transition at all, they should just repress, they should lie
26:48
down and rot. And I used to read this stuff all the time. Like I would specifically seek out threads about me.
26:54
Which might seem strange considering I had hundreds of fans telling me I was a gorgeous
26:59
goddess every day. So why did I turn away from that to intentionally seek out this dismal den of hons talking about
27:06
how my giant hon skull is clockable at a thousand paces, and my voice sounds like a ridiculous
27:11
muppet falsetto hybrid of Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh? Well basically there was part of my brain that just simply refused to believe it when people
27:20
told me I was gorgeous. And for semi-plausible reasons. A lot of trans people on the internet tell other trans people they look gorgeous no matter what they look like.
27:29
That’s where the word ""hon"" comes from. You look great hon. So what TTTT is saying about reddit hugboxing is true to some extent.
27:39
There is a kind of a priori and dogmatic flattery that prevails in some trans spaces.
27:44
So I came to regard all compliments as “everyone is beautiful,” politically correct cuckoldry.
27:50
And there would be this thrill of going to TTTT and reading other people saying what my deepest anxieties told me was really true.
27:57
And that was always painful but there was a kind of pleasure too. There was a rush.
28:02
It’s exciting to burst out of the politically correct bubble and say what you’re really thinking: that personality doesn’t matter because big-skulled Chads get all the girls,
28:10
that ContraPoints is a big-skulled hon with a voice like nails on a chalkboard. And at first I justified the habit by telling myself I was just doing research.
28:18
I have to keep tabs on what the bigots are saying, that’s simply my job. But soon I realized it wasn’t just research, and it was infecting me away from the computer.
28:26
This ridiculous vocabulary—hons, AGP—was popping up in my head at unexpected times.
28:34
It was really starting to color how I thought about myself, and worse, it was starting to infect how I thought about other trans women.
28:40
And that’s the moment I realized I need to stop looking at this stuff right now or I’m going to become a monster, and once that happens it’s going to be very difficult to fix.
28:48
This is exactly how the incel blackpill works. There’s something infectious about these vocabularies. Like on the days I’ve been working on this video, I’ll go out at night and these words
28:57
just involuntarily show up in my thoughts. That bartender is such a Chad, he’s totally height mogging that tiny cuck.
29:03
And the tragic thing is some incels don’t realize what this is doing to their minds until it’s too late.
29:08
- [V.O.] “Let’s face it; blackpills are sui fuel, and a lot of us can’t handle them.
29:15
""I gleefully indulged in this subreddit the moment I discovered it, since I loved uncovering ""secrets that society had been hiding from me, but it has affected my mental health in
29:26
""a bad way. ""I made my first call to the suicide hotline a few weeks ago, and I’ve never needed to
29:32
""do that before. ""I could always talk myself out of it through logic, but my mind is ruined now.”
29:40
- This is a form of what psychologists are calling digital self-harm, prototypically
29:45
teens who leave themselves abusive comments from sock-puppet accounts. But the more sophisticated adult version involves intentionally seeking out abusive and disparaging
29:53
comments about yourself made by other people. I have a long history of doing this, intentionally looking for abusive comments, especially ones
30:01
that cut to the core of my deepest insecurities and fears. Why? I don’t know.
30:07
Why do people cut themselves? Part of it is what we could call masochistic epistemology: whatever hurts is true.
30:14
I’ve recently gotten much better about this. I haven’t been to any of the worst places in a couple months,
30:20
and my mental health is much improved. So, incels. I’m not going to respond to your worldview like its an intellectual position worthy of rational debate.
30:28
Because these ideas and arguments, you’re not using them the way rational people use arguments. You’re using them as razor blades to abuse yourselves.
30:34
And I know because I’ve done the exact same thing. The incel worldview is catastrophizing. It’s an anxi","Hello boys. Let's talk about bone structure.

hello everyone today we're going to be
0:02
talking about doom eternal and no I
0:05
don't mean brexit that's the only joke
0:10
in today's video everyone hope you
0:12
enjoyed it so anyway before we actually
0:15
get to do am eternal
0:16
if you remember late last year I made a
0:19
video about cop head and the various non
0:22
controversies associated with it called
0:24
cop head the fake outrage which is a
0:27
cleverly ambiguous algorithm fooling
0:30
title there if I do say so myself
0:33
cop head as a recent popular game was
0:35
being discussed and critiqued by games
0:37
journalists and consumers in articles
0:39
and videos and Twitter conversations and
0:42
the likes now what my video did was
0:44
expose how various anti-feminist anti
0:46
social justice folks online lied about
0:49
the nature of the discussions and
0:51
critiques of copepod in order to conjure
0:53
the specter of an evil sjw outraged
0:55
monster that wants to take away their
0:57
audiences new favorite video game it's a
1:00
sort of constructed meta outrage you
1:03
know you act outraged about the air
1:05
quotes sjw's being outraged except you
1:08
also made the sjw's up its shameless
1:12
clickbait pandering tactics basically
1:15
cop had the fake outrage was a landmark
1:18
video in the history of games journalism
1:20
and changed the face of youtube forever
1:23
the matter outraged industry was shamed
1:26
into silence collectively promising that
1:28
in the future they would only respond
1:30
proportionally to real substantial news
1:33
stories about things that actually
1:34
happened in reality
1:36
and having gotten that completely real
1:38
set up out of the way there it's time to
1:40
take a big sip of coffee and do a
1:43
youtube search for Doom eternal oh no
1:46
what's happened here then sjw snowflakes

about doom eternal and those free

reviews and channel reason now all of
2:58
this was confusing to me as I sit on the
3:00
ruling council of sjw's here online and
3:03
I'd not heard anything about this doom
3:05
eternal stuff and I love being offended
3:07
about things so honestly it's kind of
3:09
annoying that an opportunity to be
3:10
offended seems to have slipped me by so
3:13
then let's see if we can figure out what
3:15
happened here and maybe get in on the
3:17
outrage ourselves so doom eternal is the
3:20
upcoming sequel to Ed software's 2016
3:23
reboot of the doom franchise unhelpfully
3:26
titled doom not doom 4 because [ __ ]
3:31
sequentially numbered sequels apparently
3:33
doom 2016 was an excellent game and
3:36
right for
3:36
received critical acclaim it looked
3:38
really good the music was great the fast
3:41
paced combat was consistently fun you
3:43
know whatever I'm not a games review
3:45
channel so I'll just say it was almost
3:46
always really good i streamed it
3:49
recently on my twitch channel and had a
3:51
grand old time except for one part when
3:53
the game glitched as I was killing an
3:54
enemy and dropped me out of the map but
3:56
you know otherwise it's very good now if
3:59
we want to understand all of this mess
4:01
what we do need to talk about here is
4:03
the game's narrative so spoiler warning
4:06
in the future there's some sort of
4:08
energy crisis on earth which is solved
4:11
by the Union Aerospace Corporation or
4:13
UAC opening up a portal to Hell on Mars
4:18
they then siphon quotes hell energy out
4:21
of hell and process it into usable
4:23
energy in our dimension unsurprisingly
4:26
things soon go awry and a bunch of Hell
4:29
demons invade the UAC s Mars facility
4:32
players play as the doom Slayer which is
4:35
a wonderful name whose awakened from
4:37
hibernation on Mars in order to put a
4:39
stop to the invasion and they then spend
4:42
the game hopping back and forth between
4:43
Mars and Hell accomplishing objectives
4:45
and trying to sever the link between the
4:47
world so it's a wonderfully cheesy setup
4:50
for a game store either so the question
4:52
we have to ask here is who are the
4:55
antagonists in doom well it's the demons
4:58
right all the evil hell demons you spend
5:01
your time fighting against well not
5:03
really no the hell demons are
5:06
technically evil and bad but you know
5:09
they're hell demons what do you expect
5:11
you get what you sign up for with hell
5:13
demons they're presented more as a force
5:16
of nature than anything else the actual
5:19
quotes bad guys in Doom are the UAC the
5:22
mega corporation that actually opened
5:24
the portal to Hell the leadership of the
5:27
UAC are presented as driven by profit
5:29
and greed and personal gain we have the
5:32
corrupted head of research
5:34
Olivia Pierce who ends up being the
5:36
final boss of the game and the chairman
5:38
of the UAC Samuel Hayden the soulless
5:41
CEO robot Samuel Hayden s Hayden Hayden
5:48
you get it the UAC are the reason for
5:52
the conflict in doom not the demons
5:54
Samuel Hayden is introduced right after
5:57
you wake up contacting you via a
5:59
computer screen to offer to work
6:00
together to solve this problem in a way
6:02
that benefits us both in response to it
6:05
your character grabs the computer and
6:07
just throws it away which is really
6:09
funny and shortly afterwards the
6:11
following cutscene happens and that's
6:39
the one joke in doom there it'll say
6:41
something like this was for the benefit
6:43
of mankind and then it pans to a dead
6:46
guy it's funny it's a good joke so the
6:49
point is made right at the start of the
6:51
game there the cooperation is bad and
6:53
there's plenty of jokes in the story
6:55
about the mixing of corporate culture
6:57
with the demonic invasion and notable
7:00
for us here are the various friendly
7:02
announcement holograms present
7:04
throughout the game and they say things
7:05
like weaponizing demons for a brighter
7:08
tomorrow there will be an open forum to
7:11
resolve any questions or concerns on the
7:13
initiative to weaponize the demons go
7:16
beyond mere mortal limitations see
7:19
jessica and human resources to find out
7:21
if you qualify you know
7:22
hardy-har they're using corporate speak
7:25
to put a positive spin on the demonic
7:28
invasion i apologize here i'm not making
7:30
fun of this joke
7:32
everything's just unfunny when you break
7:34
it down to the fundamentals i can't
7:35
really help ruining these jokes here
7:37
anyway this brings us to the quakecon
7:40
gameplay trailer the one that is
7:42
supposedly the source of all the SJW
7:44
outrage now this trailer also had the
7:48
friendly corporate announcement
7:49
holograms
7:51
please remain calm you may notice a
7:55
slight change a slight change in the
7:59
environment but that's not a slight
8:01
change that's a really big change you
8:04
got it
8:05
now the lines we're concerned about here
8:07
are the following my brothers and
8:09
sisters let's help to make our friends
8:12
transition into their new world a
8:13
comfortable one remember
8:16
daemon can be an offensive term refer to
8:19
them as mortally challenged and earth is
8:22
the melting pot of the universe so what
8:25
do we think about these lines well when
8:28
I watched the trailer I found them a
8:30
little eye rolling to be honest but I
8:32
figured they were just going for the
8:34
same sort of thing as the previous game
8:36
you know they're satirizing corporate
8:38
culture and particularly here they're
8:41
satirizing how corporations can co-opt
8:43
progressive language in an attempt to
8:45
spin their various evil doings well that
8:49
was my take on the trailer anyway and
8:52
because it was my opinion it was the
8:54
only correct one and anyone who had a
8:57
different opinion was wrong and I was
8:59
shocked shocked to discover anyone could
9:01
dare to think differently than me who
9:03
was right about everything I kid of
9:06
course I've been on the internet for a
9:08
while now so when I watched the trailer
9:10
I thought oh okay someone without the
9:14
full context there like someone who
9:16
didn't play or remember the previous
9:18
game in the series or just someone who
9:19
has a different opinion about the game
9:21
than me they could have read those lines
9:24
not as a satire of corporate co-opting
9:26
of progressive language but as a satire
9:28
of progressive language itself
9:30
well I'm narrative izing a bit there my
9:33
actual first thought when I watched the
9:34
trailer was mortally challenged
9:36
wasn't that a Discworld joke and then I
9:39
went and checked and I was like hey it
9:40
was there stealing Terry Pratchett's
9:42
jokes but for the purposes of this video
9:45
I'm gonna streamline my thought process
9:48
here so the next thing I thought was
9:50
there's two types of reactions here if
9:53
you're someone who thinks the trailer is
9:55
mocking progressive language if you're
9:57
on the Left you probably thought oh well
10:00
that sucks you know the previous game
10:02
could fairly be read as anti corporate
10:04
anti
10:05
capitalist pro environmentalism you know
10:07
and it was produced by Bethesda who also
10:10
produced the Wolfenstein series which
10:12
has Nazis being bad people in the story
10:15
who it's okay to fight against suis avow
10:19
that's noteworthy these days so to see
10:21
this new doom trailer pandering to anti
10:24
political correctness folks must be
10:26
fairly disappointing the other type of
10:28
reaction you could have is if you were
10:30
an anti immigrant anti political
10:32
correctness type you might think yes
10:34
excellent this game is pandering to me
10:37
for example here are the opening posts
10:40
of some Fred's about the trailer from
10:42
Fortunes far-right politics board is
10:45
there any game more anti-migrant than
10:48
new doom eternal 2019 basically replace
10:52
all the words demons with immigrants
10:55
hologram is saying doom 2018 eff is
11:00
melting part of the universe
11:02
WTF Polti Amim Zin biggest shatar if
11:05
this decade is this real-world I just
11:11
copied these into the script I didn't
11:13
practice reading these out before I
11:14
started these are really funny
11:16
doom eternal is a complete 180 and is
11:19
very blatantly making fun of the leftist
11:21
globalist SJW crowd and likening demons
11:25
to the refugees and immigrants this game
11:28
is [ __ ] red pill as [ __ ] and here's
11:31
an article from redstate.com sjw's flip
11:35
over doom eternal as it mocks leftist
11:37
political correctness on immigration and
11:40
this article manages to mention both
11:42
ms-13 and quotes rape whew geez so there
11:47
are racist anti-immigrant folks who
11:49
think the trailer was pandering to them
11:51
now I think they're wrong but the fact
11:54
that they have the space to even think
11:56
that at all means that it was kind of a
11:58
bad trailer you know I read it one way
12:01
but the trailer wasn't just made for me
12:04
was it it was made for a wide audience
12:05
some of whom thought the trailer was
12:08
being racist and they liked it
12:10
satire requires a clarity of purpose and
12:13
target lest it be mistaken for and
12:16
contribute to
12:18
that which it intends to criticise so
12:20
they say so let's take a look at some
12:23
examples of people on Twitter who talked
12:25
about not liking the trailer and these
12:27
come from a post on funnyjunk calm
12:29
titled mortally challenged controversy
12:32
one person says on one hand I'm super
12:35
excited by a lot of the things in the
12:37
new doom reveal but I'm also kinda
12:40
worried because a few of the jokes felt
12:42
questionable and then they quote one for
12:45
likes another user says the doom eternal
12:48
trailer is great but the joke that's
12:50
like remember demon is an offensive term
12:53
please call the mortally challenged
12:54
couldn't have made my eyes roll harder
12:56
one like another user says does doom
12:59
eternal seem like it has some
13:01
anti-immigration subtext to it I heard
13:04
lines from the AI like demon is an
13:06
offensive term we prefer more so he
13:08
challenged and earth is the great
13:10
melting part of the galaxy and no I'm
13:12
not imagining things and the game still
13:15
rules free likes so what am I doing here
13:18
why am i reading out these posts and why
13:21
am i saying how many likes they got well
13:23
this page on funnyjunk comm is where all
13:27
of this came from there are a dozen
13:29
tweets on this page none of which were
13:32
particularly big and the most retweeted
13:34
post on here has 7 retweets
13:37
and I'd like to point a few more things
13:39
out those free tweets that I just read
13:41
out there all mention that they think
13:43
the game looks good despite not liking
13:45
the jokes you know I'm super excited by
13:48
things in the new doom reveal the
13:49
trailers great the game still rules and
13:52
they weren't the only ones doom eternal
13:54
looking [ __ ] phenomenal but I'm not
13:57
sure how I feel about the lazy jokes
13:59
about political correctness and if you
14:01
noticed here that certain words are
14:03
highlighted they're bold because their
14:05
Twitter search terms
14:07
because whoever put this list together
14:09
had to search to find these tweets which
14:12
you know is it really a controversy if
14:15
you have to go looking for it and most
14:17
of these people seem pretty excited
14:19
about the new doom game then on some
14:21
moral crusade to ban it or anything
14:23
they're just questioning some of the
14:25
jokes in the trailer this person just
14:27
quoted one of the jokes and put a roll
14:29
eyes emoji after it
14:31
that's it that's the extent of our
14:34
outrage there one emoji no retweets for
14:38
likes you know who cares well I'll tell
14:43
you who cares Billy Dee of one angry
14:46
gamer net who wrote a post about the
14:48
funny junk article and included some
14:50
tweets of his own there which are like
14:52
the funny junk tweets fairly tame
14:54
anyways I'm hyped about new doom eternal
14:57
still but it's a muted hype because I
15:00
can't ignore that dog whistle e
15:02
immigration joke in the trailer
15:03
doom eternal looks good but I hope
15:06
they've adjusted the locked in arena
15:07
combat stuff it was too obvious and that
15:09
was about to happen the bit with the
15:11
NPC's is great some vaguely concerning
15:14
satire using the language surrounding
15:16
immigration of minorities for the demons
15:19
so we've got muted hype vague concerned
15:23
kinda wary seems kinda lame one roll
15:28
eyes emoji you know where's the outrage
15:31
here and this article finishes out by
15:34
saying the following one Twitter user
15:36
pointed out that everyone calling the
15:38
satirical nature of the Holograms
15:40
comments racist and anti-immigration
15:42
were just projecting because it meant
15:43
that sjw's see foreigners as destructive
15:46
violent demons who plot twist what if
15:49
the real racists are the people who
15:52
aren't racist never seen that one before
15:54
and that's the angle a lot of these
15:56
people talk to except as we've already
15:58
seen plenty of racists and
16:00
anti-immigration folks responded
16:03
positively to the trailer which was to
16:05
be expected to be honest so the people
16:07
being vaguely concerned about the tweets
16:10
are justified in being so they're just
16:12
thinking a couple of moves ahead of alt
16:14
Billy Dee here most of these videos are
16:17
just reading out this article and I can
16:21
prove that fairly easily look here's the
16:23
first tweet in the article and take it
16:25
away Lance not sure what to think of
16:27
doom eternal having not one but two anti
16:30
sjw jokes in it
16:32
not sure what do you think of different
16:34
they don't having not one but two aww
16:37
jokes in it not sure what to think of
16:39
doom eternal having not one but two anti
16:41
sjw joke
16:43
not share what do I'm not sure to think
16:46
of new maternal having not one but two
16:49
aunt is JW jokes in it not sure what to
16:52
think of do me turtle having not one but
16:54
two interests eww jokes in there not one
16:57
but two auntie s aww they've all made
17:02
the same [ __ ] video there were more
17:05
YouTube videos made about these tweets
17:08
than there were tweets this outrage
17:11
isn't real
17:13
it was constructed to get clicks using
17:15
the oldest advertising trick in the book
17:18
do what I say because someone you don't
17:21
like doesn't want you to do it the
17:24
psychology behind this meta outrage
17:27
industry is pretty sad really the title
17:30
of one video I showed earlier is kind of
17:32
insightful here from geeks and gamers
17:35
and it's doom eternal makes sjw's cry
17:38
and normal people are laughing at them
17:42
so it follows that if you laugh at the
17:44
sjw's you're normal
17:46
click here to be normal click here to be
17:50
part of the in-group all hating the
17:53
out-group it's the six and a half
17:55
minutes hate it's a trick played on
17:58
people mostly younger people here who
18:01
just aren't developed enough to
18:02
appreciate enjoying things on their own
18:05
terms they can only enjoy something in
18:07
relation to their peers ie my in-group
18:10
like it or more importantly and
18:12
effectively my out-group don't like it
18:15
and they want to stop me from liking it
18:18
and that's how consumerism becomes
18:21
heroism to these kids the top comment on
18:24
sargon of akkad video says any developer
18:27
in this day and age willing to stand up
18:29
against the tyranny of social justice
18:31
deserves a pre-order for every snowflake
18:34
here they cause yeah well done guys
18:38
you're really sticking it to them by
18:39
falling into an easy marketing trap
18:41
aren't you you could sell these kids
18:44
sand in the desert if you told them
18:46
sjw's didn't like it back to the trailer
18:49
for a second here and this is my cynical
18:51
anti capitalist side talking but the
18:54
people who put the trailers together for
18:56
these
18:57
names often aren't the people who
18:59
designed the game and maybe they put
19:01
those jokes in the trailer deliberately
19:03
to spark this kind of discussion it's
19:05
something I'm noticing more of and it's
19:08
companies saying you know if we're sort
19:10
of ambiguously but not really or
19:14
arguably racist
19:16
everyone's gonna argue about whether we
19:18
were racist or not and in the process
19:20
they'll be talking about our product and
19:23
from funnyjunk
19:25
to one angry gamer to all these guys to
19:28
me and then to you now we did talk about
19:31
it what a human centipede of content we
19:34
have here is that what happened maybe it
19:39
worked if so you know Bravo marketing
19:42
guys you made us all talk about doom
19:44
congratulations you soulless
19:46
manipulative parasites and I hope that
19:49
is what happened actually because there
19:51
is another alternative here that I don't
19:53
really want to be the truth because I
19:54
was looking forward to this game but
19:57
maybe the game is just bad maybe it's
20:00
just rubbish now doom 2016 was
20:03
surprisingly good and surprisingly
20:05
popular and it's possible that going
20:07
forward the series will chase that
20:09
popularity and lose what message it had
20:12
look at another bethesda produced game
20:15
that's coming up fallout 76 now fallout
20:19
was a game series initially about the
20:21
horrors of surviving in a
20:22
post-apocalyptic nuclear wasteland and
20:25
now is being marketed as get together
20:27
with all your pals and nuke the next
20:29
town to get some loot crate's or
20:32
whatever so it's possible that this game
20:35
is just gonna be crap maybe they'll
20:38
forget the messaging of the previous
20:39
game and put out a story in which the
20:42
demons are just bad Outsiders who need
20:44
to be killed because they're bad maybe
20:47
they'll forget that Samuel Hayden is
20:49
supposed to be the bad guy
20:51
or they'll have him as the final boss
20:52
for no other reason than he's a
20:54
character in the series who could be a
20:56
final boss instead of it making
20:58
narrative sense for him to play that
21:00
role I don't know I hope not but it's
21:03
all possible so good job
21:06
doomed trailer you make me wonder about
21:07
how much worse than its predecessor
21:10
so the next game is going to be well you
21:13
know the shotgun has the hook on it now
21:16
and looks cool it's about time for me to
21:19
wrap up here folks but sympathize with
21:22
me a little I usually like to end my
21:24
video scripts on something weighty you
21:26
know something with some punch to it but
21:29
that's difficult here because nothing
21:31
happened
21:31
you know lots of people said something
21:33
happened there but it didn't and it was
21:36
relatively trivial to show that it
21:38
didn't happen to so I'm a bit deflated
21:41
to be honest I feel like this one's just
21:42
gonna fizzle out I don't have anything
21:45
killer to go out on I could talk about
21:47
the hypocrisy of the YouTube outrage
21:49
industry solely targeting quote sjw's
21:53
when there are plenty of examples of
21:54
racists taking the trailer seriously
21:57
online you know you could make a video
21:59
in the style of one of there's going
22:01
through a poll thread or whatever and
22:02
mocking all the people thinking the game
22:04
is quote read pilled and the likes they
22:07
don't do that though do they
22:09
it's sort of revealing in its absence
22:11
there so why do they instead endlessly
22:15
attack this nebulous idea of sjw's and
22:19
it's because the narrative they've built
22:21
needs enemies and sjw's are good and
22:25
useful enemies anyone can be one there's
22:29
no criteria for it other than doing
22:31
something that anti is JW don't like
22:34
such as not being sufficiently excited
22:37
about a video game trailer sjw's are
22:39
crazed mindless opponents who are
22:42
numberless can turn up anywhere and are
22:45
always easily defeated while somehow
22:48
simultaneously being the puppet masters
22:50
behind a conspiracy to destroy a Western
22:52
civilization sjw's hate us for being
22:56
straight white males and thus we never
22:58
have to feel bad about fighting them
23:00
they hate us just because so our hatred
23:03
of them is justified it's a narrative of
23:06
victimization they want to be under
23:09
attack but they don't ever want to
23:10
actually risk being beaten so they make
23:13
up an easy enemy to fight and then to
23:16
maintain the illusion they just have to
23:18
selectively turn their brains off every
23:20
now and then and watch a man complain to
23:22
700
23:23
thousand people that are tweet with two
23:26
likes on it is taking something too
23:28
seriously thanks a lot for watching
23:31
everyone what do we think was that
23:33
punchy enough of an ending there I don't
23:36
know it'll do won't it I went with the
23:38
SJW demon comparison there but I didn't
23:41
outright state it and that way anyone
23:43
who noticed it would feel clever it's
23:46
the best I could do given the
23:47
circumstances it's hard to make a video
23:49
where nothing happens you know I wish I
23:52
could just read out other people's
23:54
articles I found on the internet that
23:55
it'd be easy if I was this Billy Dee
23:58
chap over at one angry gamer or whatever
24:00
I'd be furious I didn't see that in the
24:03
script either of course he'd be furious
24:04
he's one angry gamer well yeah all those
24:07
people just copying his article it's
24:10
terrible if you'd like more videos about
24:12
nothing consider supporting me on
24:14
patreon the links below along with links
24:17
to my Twitter and curious cat accounts
24:18
if you feel like giving me a follow or
24:20
sending in a question thanks a lot to
24:22
all my current supporters as always I do
24:24
have videos coming up that are actually
24:27
about things don't worry folks ok that's
24:30
it from me today

0:07
what is it about Disney Animation that
0:09
makes those films so compelling beyond
0:11
the storytelling what is it about the
0:13
characteristics of the animation itself
0:14
that convinces us that the Disney style
0:16
is alive I think that style often gets
0:19
mistakenly attributed to the design
0:20
exaggerated proportions soft features
0:23
and those big expressive eyes but Disney
0:25
has a wide variety of character Styles
0:27
and their visual approach changes pretty
0:29
drastically from film the film the real
0:31
Disney style isn't in design but in
0:33
technique techniques that are Universal
0:35
and style agnostic which is why when
0:37
budgets were tight Disney was Notorious
0:39
for repurposing animation from its
0:41
archive to save time and they were able
0:42
to recycle that work between two
0:44
completely different characters because
0:45
those techniques are just a framework a
0:48
skeleton that can fit within the mold of
0:49
any design or any process and that
0:51
framework was cataloged and published in
0:53
the 1981 animation Bible the illusion of
0:56
life written by Frank Thomas and Ollie
0:58
Johnston and if you're not familiar with
0:59
Frank and Ollie they're two of the nine
1:01
old men the best of Disney's animators
1:03
in the early years of the studio and
1:05
they each had their own particular
1:06
string
1:08
rest some are incredible draftsman
1:09
others were known for their action but
1:11
Frank and Ali specialized in sincere
1:13
character expression and today we're
1:15
going to take a look at the 12
1:16
principles that the two of them
1:18
standardized in that book and how
1:19
they've been utilized by the Masters at
1:21
Disney over the years to make life out
1:23
of graphite so if you're looking to
1:25
explore animating for yourself or even
1:26
if you just have a passing interest in
1:28
the mechanics of The Craft these are the
1:29
basic tools that make up the groundwork
1:31
of the discipline starting with the
Squash &Stretch
1:33
first and probably the most versatile of
1:34
all the techniques of Animation squash
1:37
and stretch the key to creating a
1:39
convincing organic material is
1:40
elasticity and the degree to which its
1:43
use can tell you a lot about something's
1:44
overall weight mass or direction of
1:46
motion and if a character has a bit of
1:48
malleability it's going to keep it from
1:49
appearing rigid and lifeless squashing
1:51
and stretching the material is a good
1:53
way to display a more accurate sense of
1:54
gravity and a character's flexibility
1:56
will open the animation up to more
1:58
expressive and relatable gestures you
2:00
can see this technique at work in a
2:01
character like Lottie from The Princess
2:02
and the Frog she's almost entirely made
2:04
up of several flexible rounder shapes
2:06
and the Squash and stretch gives way
2:07
weight and energy toward bouncy
2:09
movements while also giving a more
2:11
naturalistic quality to the animation it
2:12
makes the action more readable for the
2:14
Audience by bringing it a bit closer to
2:16
reality and achieving a sense of realism
2:17
is important but the goal should always
2:19
be to approximate real world physics
2:22
here so something like squash and
2:23
stretch is going to be more a feeling
2:25
than it is a Formula but we are playing
2:27
with Newton's third law so remember that
2:28
it's squash and stretch not squash or
2:31
stretch meaning your object or character
2:33
needs to retain a consistent Mass
2:34
throughout its motion up and in down and
2:37
out because every action has an equal
2:39
and opposite reaction which is also true
2:41
of our next principle anticipation
Anticipation
2:43
anticipation is best described as the
2:45
preparation for the main action so again
2:47
we're dealing with Newton's third law
2:48
the action being the build and the
2:51
reaction being the release Frank and
2:52
only referred to it as broadcasting
2:54
intent it's not about waiting for the
2:56
action to begin it's the charge that's
2:58
going to direct it to where it needs to
3:00
go it also acts as a signal to the
3:02
audience to draw their attention to the
3:03
start of an important motion think of it
3:05
like an elastic band you're stretching
3:07
the action back so that it can spring
3:09
forward and here's what it looks like
3:10
without the anticipation
3:14
blinked you probably missed it much like
3:16
with squash and stretch anticipation is
3:18
used to make the action more readable
3:19
for the audience in some cases you can
3:21
get rid of it to convey speed or
3:22
surprise but for the most part if you
3:24
want your movements to be believable
3:26
they need to be anticipated first it's
3:28
all about directing the focus of a
3:30
viewer's eye and an important part of
3:31
directing focus is proper staging now
Staging
3:34
staging is one of the broader principles
3:35
on this list but it essentially boils
3:37
down to Clarity and expression and
3:39
Clarity and direction of action the
3:41
non-verbal communication that comes from
3:43
contrast color camera angles composition
3:45
how your visual elements are arranged in
3:48
the frame you don't want a cluttered
3:49
image with lots of conflicting shapes
3:51
competing for attention you want your
3:52
characters to pop and their overall form
3:54
needs to be as distinct and as
3:56
unambiguous as possible that's the
3:58
reason Mickey's ears are always
3:59
equidistant regardless of the position
4:01
of his head you always want a clear
4:03
clean easily understood silhouette even
4:06
if that means smudging reality just a
4:07
little bit Clarity of intent can usually
4:09
be at a slightly higher priority than
4:11
realism the real important factors are
4:13
strong composition Dynamic lines of
4:16
action and a consistent visual language
4:18
so stick to your geometric shapes rule
4:20
of thirds Fibonacci all that good stuff
4:22
whatever you can do to draw an
4:24
audience's Focus to where it needs to go
4:25
an easy way to do this is to break an
4:27
image down into its complexity straight
4:29
lines guide the eye quicker and curves
4:31
slow them down so you want your area of
4:32
attention to be more complex and then
4:34
frame those more complex lines with
4:36
simple lines the more organized the
4:38
frame the more coherent the storytelling
4:40
can be and more often than not with
4:42
Disney films the frame is the story
4:44
let's look at a simple scene like this
4:45
for example when Nani Lilo and Stitch
4:47
are brought under the protection of the
4:49
United Galactic Federation rather than
4:51
just delivering that Exposition through
4:52
dialogue The Grand councilwoman is also
4:54
shaped into a literal protective barrier
4:57
around the three of them staging is as
4:59
much a narrative tool as it is an
5:01
aesthetic one and if you can represent
5:02
the whole of an idea in just a line or
5:04
two then you have a strong line of
5:06
action a strong line of action is
5:08
important because that's the core of the
5:09
expression if you look at some Mickey
5:11
poses again here you can see he's
5:12
jubilant assertive frightened or patient
5:15
and it's all built out of a single line
5:17
that's the base of the drawing and the
5:18
rest is fleshed out around it so you
5:20
need a strong Foundation if you're going
5:21
to sell an emotion through that action
5:23
and when we create that action we can do
5:25
it in two different ways and that brings
5:26
us to Straight Ahead action and post to
Straight Ahead / Pose to Pose
5:28
pose now straight head action and post
5:30
to pose are actually workflow related
5:32
and not technically principles of the
5:33
animation itself but still just as
5:35
important as the rest because it
5:36
pertains to the manner in which the
5:37
motion of a character object is drawn in
5:40
sequence the straight ad method is more
5:41
stream of Consciousness drawing each
5:43
frame one after the other it's sort of
5:45
an improvisational approach to animating
5:47
and there's a freshness and an energy
5:48
that comes along with that but it's
5:50
going to be a lot harder to maintain
5:51
consistency so not ideal for longer
5:54
highly choreographed actions but it's
5:56
really useful when animating fluid
5:57
effects like smoke fire or things like
5:59
this incredible transformation sequence
6:01
from Cinderella it'd be impossible to
6:03
predict the position of those tiny fairy
6:05
dust particles with the post to pose
6:06
method which is more structured and
6:08
methodical so rather than drawing each
6:10
frame in chronological order you'll
6:12
maybe plot out the main beats of the
6:13
action at frames 129
6:15
952-67 Etc and then go back through and
6:18
fill in the meat of the action between
6:19
the key drawings so you're losing some
6:20
of that spark and spontaneity that comes
6:22
from extemporaneously animating straight
6:24
through a scene but post to pose will
6:26
keep your proportions size and Direction
6:28
more consistent because you have a lot
6:29
more control seeing it from a bird's eye
6:31
perspective but which method you use is
6:33
solely dependent on the context of the
6:35
piece and nine times out of ten they'll
6:36
be used in tandem anyway often on top of
6:38
each other within the same frame the
6:39
things like David's fired it sequence
6:41
from Lilo and Stitch here the
6:43
performance is animated using the post
6:44
to pose method along with reference to
6:46
keep the choreography consistent and the
6:47
less predictable elements like the fire
6:49
and the grass like ties were animated
6:51
with the straight ahead method and if we
6:52
take a closer look at this scene here we
6:55
can see our fifth principle in play
6:56
follow through and overlapping action
Follow Through / Overlapping Action
6:59
anything that's not a part of the core
7:01
mass of a moving object is going to move
7:02
at a different rate so things like long
7:04
hair loose clothing or hanging
7:06
accessories are all going to be playing
7:08
catch-up to the main action and if the
7:10
force of that main action abruptly stops
7:12
the momentum carried by everything else
7:14
will fall follow through swinging past
7:16
the stopping point before eventually
7:17
settling Tarzan's dreads are a great
7:19
example of this principle at work since
7:21
they're individually animated locks
7:22
instead of the solid hair piece of most
7:24
long-haired Disney characters and his
7:26
wild hyper agile acrobatics are pretty
7:28
implausible but that accurate sense of
7:30
gravity displayed by his hair keeps the
7:32
animation anchored in reality it also
7:34
gives a looseness and a fluidity to the
7:35
motion by emphasizing the Direction with
7:37
animation you can usually get away with
7:39
implausibility as long as the physics of
7:41
the motion feel organic and a useful
7:43
tool for accomplishing that is ease in
Ease In / Ease Out
7:45
and ease out ease in being the gradual
7:47
acceleration into emotion from a keep
7:49
pose and ease out being the gradual
7:51
deceleration so what we're really
7:53
looking at here is spacing the distance
7:55
between the individual frames for this
7:57
example we have roughly 15 frames for
7:59
the in 15 frames for the out and 15
8:01
frames for the in-between but notice
8:03
that the in and the out are a fraction
8:05
of the length apart compared to the
8:06
in-betweens which makes the perceived
8:08
speed of the ball much quicker in the
8:09
center and slower on the ends and
8:11
without that exponential spacing you get
8:13
this which is called linear spacing
8:15
fewer drawings make the action faster
8:17
and more drawings make the action slower
8:19
so think of it like a swinging pendulum
8:20
more frames in the ends and fewer in the
8:22
center are going to soften the action
8:23
making it more natural and just like
8:24
with anticipation you can remove it to
8:26
make the action snappier or to sell a
8:28
gag easing is a great tool for adding
8:30
some authenticity to your movements and
8:32
it works particularly well when paired
8:34
with our next principle arcs so this
Arcs
8:36
one's pretty simple there's one thing
8:38
you'll very rarely find in nature and
8:40
that is a straight line and what's true
8:41
of nature is also true of Animation if
8:43
you want your movements to flow your
8:45
visual path needs to follow an arched
8:47
trajectory and if we look here at our
8:48
bouncing ball again you can see the
8:50
effect that a forward momentum has on an
8:52
object in motion and if we combine that
8:53
with our ease in and ease out Technique
8:55
we can get some really smooth graceful
8:57
convincing movement let's take a look at
9:00
this scene with Shere Khan stalking its
9:02
prey watch the path of his head as the
9:04
sound catches his attention it moves
9:06
along a circular path outward from a
9:08
single Anchor Point and you also get a
9:10
bit of squash and stretch and
9:11
anticipation in there as well that's
9:12
what keeps it from looking stiff and
9:14
inorganic another way to add some life
9:16
into a character's movement is through
9:17
secondary actions this is where the
Secondary Action
9:19
animation can really Express itself and
9:21
bring out those idiosyncrasies that
9:23
individualize a character secondary
9:24
actions are just the layers of
9:26
supporting gestures that are applied to
9:28
sweeten the main action and this is
9:29
different from our fifth principle in
9:31
that it's independent action rather than
9:33
momentum-based motion following through
9:34
from a primary action so think of it
9:36
less as the Motions linked to physics
9:38
like here with Phil's beard tail and
9:40
hair and think of it more as the actions
9:42
linked to attitude demeanor and
9:44
personality Pinocchio for instance has
9:46
these little nervous ticks during his
9:48
performance you can see he scratches his
9:49
leg and Twirls his finger in his shorts
9:51
It's just revealing a bit more as to
9:53
what's going on in this character's head
9:54
Stitch's ears are another good example
9:56
of characterization through secondary
9:58
action because they move independently
9:59
from the rest of his body and they give
10:01
us some insight into what emotions he's
10:02
currently feeling and that's useful
10:04
since he's not the best at articulating
10:05
those emotions verbally you can also
10:07
gather that information by observing a
10:09
character's timing which is our ninth
Timing
10:11
principle so remember back with ease in
10:12
and ease out how we talked about spacing
10:14
being the disc between the frames well
10:16
timing is just the number of frames
10:18
themselves how many individual drawings
10:20
it takes for an action to be completed
10:22
which in turn dictates the speed of that
10:23
action more frames mean slower fewer
10:25
frames means faster and you have two
10:27
types of timing the physical which is
10:29
influenced by weight and mass and will
10:30
give you an idea of the material of the
10:32
object and then you have theatrical
10:33
timing which is behavioral and
10:35
influenced by performance if we look at
10:37
the Seven Dwarves the theatrical timing
10:39
of their actions reveals a lot about
10:40
their individual personalities this
10:42
scene in The Script just reads each
10:44
dwarf sticks out their hands if each of
10:46
their timing for this action was
10:47
identical they'd be pretty
10:48
indistinguishable outside of their
10:50
physical traits which already aren't too
10:51
distinct so you'd have a much duller
10:53
Ensemble since you'd be losing what
10:55
makes those characters so interesting to
10:57
watch which is those contrasting
10:58
identities we're able to get the gist of
11:00
who these guys are just by their timing
11:02
and those few exaggerated actions which
11:05
brings us to our next principle
Exaggeration
11:06
exaggeration exaggeration is exactly
11:09
what it sounds like you're amplifying an
11:10
expression to make it more readable and
11:12
this can be applied to nearly every
11:13
other principle on this list to some
11:15
degree an exaggerated squash and stretch
11:17
or Arc for example could change the
11:19
weight speed and trajectory of your
11:20
object or you could exaggerate the
11:22
anticipation if you wanted to really
11:24
build up the power behind an action an
11:26
animation a caricature of an action is
11:28
always going to read better than a
11:29
direct one-to-one replication of that
11:31
action in reality that's the Paradox of
11:33
The Uncanny Valley the closer you are to
11:35
Absolute realism the more dull and
11:37
unconvincing your character becomes so
11:39
with animation you take a different
11:40
approach rather than focusing on those
11:42
uncapturable finer details would dial up
11:44
the intensity of the broader actions
11:46
enhancing the emotion making the
11:48
expression as large and as clear as
11:50
necessary but you have to execute your
11:52
exaggeration while still being mindful
11:53
staying on model and being
11:54
proportionally and anatomically accurate
11:57
and can't have anatomical accuracy
11:58
without our 11th principle solid drawing
Solid Drawing
12:01
when milk call was asked what makes
12:03
Disney characters stand out from the
12:04
competition he said that Disney
12:05
characters distinguish themselves from
12:07
the ones at other Studios because they
12:08
have real bones and muscles a good
12:10
animator doesn't think in two Dimensions
12:13
because animated characters aren't made
12:14
up of circles squares and triangles when
12:17
done right they're made up of spheres
12:18
cubes and pyramids the reason a
12:20
character like Megara feels like she has
12:22
weight and dimension is because she was
12:24
designed with the form of classical
12:26
Greek pottery in mind solid designs are
12:28
going to give your characters a sense of
12:30
tangibility and that will affect how
12:31
they can interact with their environment
12:32
or play off a moving camera even subtle
12:35
garnishes like having light wrap around
12:36
your character like it would a
12:37
three-dimensional object is going to
12:39
lend some Credence to the drawing and
12:40
with some cases you're not going to have
12:41
a completely recognizable Anatomy Tech
12:43
Genie for example is a semi-gase magical
12:46
shapeshifter he doesn't have a
12:48
traditional bone structure but he isn't
12:50
an amorphous blob he has very clearly
12:52
defined proportions when he's in his
12:53
neutral State and any changes to that
12:55
form would be immediately noticeable
12:57
even if a form is exaggerated or
12:59
squashed and stretched it still needs to
13:01
adhere to a solid anatomical structure
13:03
and that structure doesn't necessarily
13:04
have to be completely realistic but it
13:07
should be believable and believability
13:09
is absolutely necessary in order to
13:10
achieve our 12th and final principle
13:12
appeal now appeal is something that that
Appeal
13:15
you strive for so there's some
13:17
subjectivity there unlike with the other
13:18
principles but it's essentially the
13:20
culmination of all the other techniques
13:22
we've discussed today and how effective
13:24
they are at creating a fully realized
13:26
unquestionably authentic character let's
13:28
take a look at this walk cycle of
13:29
Pinocchio you can see there's
13:31
anticipation in his gate his arms move
13:33
in arcs there's some overlapping motion
13:34
with his hair and Cat feather you can
13:36
find nearly every principle at use in
13:38
something as simple and as rough as this
13:40
and all of these qualities working in
13:42
Harmony are going to determine a
13:43
character's watch ability and
13:45
attractiveness and this isn't just
13:46
limited to perfectly symmetrical
13:48
traditionally attractive humanoid
13:50
characters any and everything in
13:52
animation can be appealing because
13:53
appeal is about more than just a
13:55
character's appearance Disney can make a
13:57
candelabra a doorknob or a featureless
13:59
carpet appealing because their movements
14:01
are entertaining and unique and
14:03
perfectly complementary to their
14:04
physical traits and if you can link the
14:06
characteristics of the movement with the
14:08
characteristics of the design then you
14:10
have an appealing character in the
14:12
illusion of Life Frank and Ollie put it
14:13
as simple as this a live action
14:15
performer has Charisma and an animated
14:17
character has appeal so there you have
14:20
it you've had your Peak behind the
14:21
curtain and now you know everything
14:22
there is to know about animation
14:24
well not quite these are just the first
14:26
12 basic principles animation at its
14:29
most stripped down fundamental elements
14:31
and there are dozens of other techniques
14:32
in play anytime you see an animated
14:34
piece of art and the mark of a great
14:35
animator is knowing when and how to use
14:37
them effectively and understanding that
14:40
animation has all the possibilities of
14:41
life without any of its limitations and
14:44
that's why even with that people behind
14:46
the curtain even knowing how the sausage
14:48
is made examining every line and flip of
14:50
the page you're still lost in the Mirage
14:52
we all are because what you're seeing
14:54
isn't just the illusion of life you're
14:57
seeing the magic of animation

There are a few things you can't do on YouTube.
0:11
Chief among them is this:
0:15
Playing a long unedited clip of a film you did not make.
0:23
The YouTube Content ID system is trained to look for long clips of unedited footage.
0:30
If it sees it, it flags it.
0:33
The length can vary. Ten to thirty seconds is common.
0:43
You can get around it with various editing tricks --
0:46
scale the footage down, put it in a frame,
0:49
flip the footage around, speed it up,
0:50
slow it down, play it next to other clips in the same frame -- basically,
0:55
do anything to fundamentally alter the sequence of images that appear in the frame.
1:01
This is why, for example, so many video essays take the form of super-cuts --
1:05
quick, little moments like these don't matter much to a Content ID algorithm --
1:10
and why so many great video essayists chose to talk about subjects whose work can be expressed with short,
1:16
punchy clips: the camera work of Michael Bay, the production design of Wes Anderson, that sort of thing.
1:25
And it's why so few video essays show long, unedited clips.
1:31
Or long, single takes.
1:35
Like this one.
1:40
I've always thought that this system made some sense.
1:43
If you're a copyright holder and you need a program to look for copyright violations,
1:47
you'll want to go after instances where the footage is unaltered, where the clip hasn't been transformed.
1:54
The algorithm operates on the belief that the essence of a movie is time.
2:00
Captured once, it is the unaltered, unchanging truth of what a camera sees.
2:09
The director of this scene would agree.
3:15
So this scene from Andre Tarkovsky's masterpiece, Nostalgia,
3:19
which documents a single task being completed in real time, is nearly impossible to show on YouTube.
3:26
[Don Draper:] Nostalgia:
3:28
It's delicate,
3:31
but potent.
3:32
[Kyle] Now, if you're a fan of Mad Men, you probably think you know the etymology of the word ""nostalgia.""
3:39
[Don Draper:] In Greek,
3:40
nostalgia literally means
3:43
the pain from an old wound.
3:45
[Kyle] Don Draper's not accurate here.
3:47
""Algos"" is the Greek word for pain, but ""nostos"" doesn't mean ""wound""; it means ""to come home.""
3:55
It's a rough cognate with the English word ""nest.""
4:00
Nostalgia:
4:01
The pain to return home.
4:04
[Film narrator:] This is the first photograph I ever made with the direct intention of making art
4:08
[Kyle] This is from another film called ""nostalgia,"" by experimental director Hollis Frampton
4:15
His narration describes photographs. His camera shows the photographs.
4:21
Shows them as they burn.
4:25
And the descriptions of the photos don't match.
4:28
The voiceover describes the next photo in the sequence, not the current one.
4:33
Photographs, themselves captured time,
4:37
which now only exist as records of their own destruction.
4:41
And as we see them burned,
4:43
we're already starting to forget their stories, as we struggle to remember the present.
4:50
The future, described.
4:52
The past, presented as it's destroyed.
4:59
There's a reason this character is doing this -- why he's trying to carry a candle across a pool.
5:05
Because he met a maniac who thought the world was going to end,
5:09
and so he kept his family locked away for the better part of a decade
5:14
to protect them.
5:15
He tried carrying a candle across the pool of Saint Catherine and therefore
5:20
save the world.
5:22
He wound up publicly immolating himself in a bold, futile gesture.
5:28
In the film, our protagonist, a Russian in Italy, is trying to honor that madman
5:37
By taking his time.
5:43
The other factor in the algorithm is which companies decide to run which properties through the Content ID system.
5:49
So clips of latest blockbusters, with armies of copyright lawyers maximizing opening weekend profits, are the most likely to go down.
5:58
Some companies don't mind full reproductions as long as there's some transformative element,
6:03
because they know that meme YouTube can get plenty of mileage out of certain copyrighted clips.
6:09
And if full movies do exist on YouTube, they're only ones which no one cares about anymore,
6:16
ones past their marketability
6:19
There was an essay by Daniel Fairfax in the June 2018 issue of Senses of Cinema where he described how weird it was
6:25
to rediscover this made-for-tv Stephen King adaptation in its entirety on YouTube.
6:32
Absolutely the kind of thing that couldn't be made today.
6:37
Fittingly,
6:38
It's a movie about otherworldly monsters who swallow up the past when the past is no longer needed.
6:46
Fairfax called YouTube ""the archive of detritus"":
6:50
a dumping ground for undesired intellectual property.
6:54
And, seemingly, a great place to talk about cruddy old movies, dumb commercials --
6:59
things from the pre-streaming era of media.
7:03
Resurrected by jaded adults furious that they are no longer children.
7:10
Makes sense.
7:12
Until YouTube started cracking down on them.
7:16
Which led to the support of smaller video hosting sites,
7:20
like...
7:22
Blip.
7:23
Whose main draw outside of YouTube was its lack of a Content ID system.
7:31
I... used to be on blip.
7:36
It's been dead for, um,
7:39
three years now.
7:42
And, here I am, still listening to the orders of a maniac convinced the world was about to end.
7:49
even though the man was a fool, an abuser, cruel in his neglect, but... when you do something long enough
7:58
you tend to forget why you started.
8:02
And eventually it just becomes about the act itself.
8:07
And the reason why you started
8:09
becomes unimportant.
8:12
And you keep going, because you're in a constant present,
8:16
and it's not about memory, the past, or your future, but
8:21
just about doing the task before you.
8:25
Just about taking the next step.
8:30
Just about staying present in this moment of captured time.
8:38
Keeping the flame burning.","A reflection on cinema, self, and other nonsense.

In Search Of A Flat Earth,"3,423,150","129,000",9/11/20,1:16:16,"Prologue
0:00
[Laid back folk music] A few minutes outside Banff, Alberta, there’s a serpentine lake,
0:08
Lake Minnewanka. It’s a gorgeous lake, perfect for day trips, boating, hiking, camping, and even SCUBA diving.
0:16
It’s actually a natural lake, but not as it currently exists. The outlet has been dammed three times, first a small
0:24
timber dam was constructed for flood control in 1895, replaced with a hydroelectric dam in 1912, with the final and current dam
0:33
and causeway finishing construction in 1941. Cumulatively these damming projects have raised the surface of the lake over 25 metres,
0:42
flooding the original shoreline, a small settler town, and dozens of ancient Stoney Nakoda worksites.
0:49
A number of these old ruins, which you can see marked by buoys, are popular cold water diving destinations.
0:56
And if you wanted to demonstrate the curve of the earth it would be an ideal place to do it.
1:02
So you can see that the water Clearly has no curvature.
1:09
That the water surface is completely flat.v Wait, back up.
1:16
Why are we demonstrating the curve of the earth? About five, six years back I got really into Flat Earth theories,
1:22
not as a believer but as an observer. I would check in on them and watch their documentaries
1:28
and read through their memes and infographics and generally have a jolly good time poking fun at them on Twitter.
1:34
I was, at one point, building up to making a video on the subject when known moon-criminal Hbomberguy produced his video on Flat Earth,
1:42
and due to YouTube Community Standards and bylaws, section 7.2.1, the Para-Temporal Exclusion Clause,
1:49
aka “reviewer dibs” I had to shelve my plans for a year and change.

The thing that really spurred me on originally was a specific Flat Earth video I came across one evening in 2017.
2:01
SubtitleFlat Earth proof 1: the level Now, this video is not particularly noteworthy
2:08
in the scope of Flat Earth videos. It’s an hour and a half compilation of short videos stolen from a different, smaller Flat Earth YouTube channel.
2:16
It runs through the normal Flat Earth tropes, such as not understanding gravity,
2:22
failing to appreciate just how big mountains really are, and generally being really bad at math.
2:28
There was no basis for such an explanation, other than the desperate attempt to excuse away these critical findings.
2:36
But there is one thing that makes it special. The host of the video does some original research
2:42
by going out to the shore of Lake Minnewanka. Okay, here we are at Lake Minnewanka. In Alberta.
2:51
Thing is, Lake Minnewanka is only 90 minutes away from my house.
2:56
The Flat Earth is in my own backyard. So, hypothetically, if I did want to debunk a forgotten
3:04
four year old Flat Earth video that originally had a couple hundred views, I could conceivably jump in my car on a clear day,
3:12
drive out to Lake Minnewanka, and set up a camera with the longest lens I own.
3:18
But that’d be ludicrous. [Intense music]
Part 1
5:01
Okay, here we are at Lake Minnewanka. In Alberta.
5:08
And as you can see we're just less than a foot above the water's surface here.
5:19
And if we zoom in across the lake, the coastline across the lake clearly comes into focus.
5:32
So you can see that the water clearly has no curvature.
5:42
That the water surface is completely flat. Okay, so, let’s talk real quick about the challenges involved in this kind of proof.
5:51
Going out to Minnewanka was actually a really good pick. Because the lake is really long there’s a lot of shoreline
5:59
where you have several kilometres of unobstructed line of sight, far enough for the curve of the earth to be meaningful,
6:05
while the mountainous terrain provides a clearly identifiable shore on the other side.
6:10
And while the lake is long enough to get these really far lines of sight, it’s not big enough to get any meaningful tidal movements,
6:19
so all the waves are just from wind blowing across the surface, you don’t get the big, roiling surges that you see in the ocean.
6:26
From the dam that makes up the south-west bank of Lake Minnewanka to the rock slide on the far shore where Aylmer canyon meets the lake,
6:33
you have a line of sight of seven kilometres, about four and a third miles, which is far enough that the earth curves away around 3 and a half metres,
6:42
or eleven feet. This is a kinda perfect distance. It’s close enough for objects on the far side to still be identifiable,
6:50
while being a significant enough curve that the obstruction is perceptible. If we punch a bunch of numbers into a curvature calculator
6:58
we can see that going from just barely above the water’s surface to an average adult height,
7:04
the height of a hidden object at 7 kilometres goes from 3.46 metres to only 0.4 metres.
7:11
This means that something the size of a tree at or near the water level of the lake should appear just about whole when viewed from a standing position,
7:19
but then be visibly obscured by getting down to the surface of the water. So the experiment should be pretty simple:
7:25
pick a landmark on the far side of the lake and record it at the same focal length and distance
7:31
from a couple different elevations above the water’s surface. Personally I think that his footage does, in fact, show the far shore disappearing behind the curve,
7:40
it's just very difficult to tell because the resolution is so low. So, let’s say, for the sake of argument,
7:46
that an obscure Flat Earth video is still under your skin after several years. What do you do?
7:53
Well, obviously, you throw a bunch of gear into the car, drive out to the mountains, set up on the side of the lake,
7:59
and spend an hour aiming at a tree on the far shore, keeping in mind that if you want to persuade Flat Earthers then you need to
8:06
eliminate as much ambiguity as possible, so make sure to include an identifiable landmark in the shots
8:12
to make it easy to pinpoint exactly where you’re standing and where you’re looking. Everything gets documented:
8:18
where was the camera sitting on the beach, approximately how high above the surface, even screencaps of where GPS says you’re standing.
8:26
You get the footage home, import it, tweak the scale to make sure that objects are the same size on screen,
8:32
and line it all up with a unified horizon. There you go, the tree disappears below the horizon of the lake.
8:38
Easy. The earth is round.
8:45
Mmm, yeah, but if I were into Flat Earth you know what I’d point out?
8:50
That last frame, the one that’s right above the surface of the water, it’s really hazy, ‘cus it turns out that on a thirty degree day
8:58
there’s gonna be a lot of vapour coming off the surface of the lake, and at water level you’re trying to look
9:04
straight through seven kilometres of the stuff. And having such a stark air temperature gradient right at the surface of the water
9:11
it increases atmospheric refraction, resulting in the mirage effect that allows the pebble beach to
9:17
occasionally be somewhat visible, despite intersecting the tree that it’s below.
9:22
So, you know, a Flat Earther could just dismiss all of this as just heat coming off the water.
9:28
And the shots are all locked off and disconnected. There’s no continuity. Who knows what shenanigans you can get up to when the camera cuts.
9:36
Plus, I mean, look at it, all that straightening and zooming in post, how can anyone trust that the camera is set to what you say it’s set to?
9:44
So! Jump back in the car two days later, when it’s partly cloudy and fifteen degrees cooler.
9:50
There’s a lot more chop from the wind, but the waves are short. It’s still a lake, we’re not dealing with big ocean swells.
9:57
Importantly, there’s functionally no visible vapour coming off the surface of the water. And this time you make sure to bring the jib so you can
10:05
smoothly go from standing to the surface of the water in a single motion and…
10:10
[Delicate piano music]
11:19
We checked the footage when we were out there on the lake, we looked at it on the camera just to make sure that we got something,
11:28
and so we, we knew that we got it but, but getting home and, and seeing it in, in this detail, like this level of clarity
11:42
It's, it's, honestly it's kinda affecting me. You know, you can see this just with the naked eye when you're out there on the beach.
11:51
You can pick a thing on the far shore and just kinda look at it and then like crouch down
12:00
and get like really close to the water's surface and you see it get, get occluded but, but
12:09
Seeing it at this magnitude, it,
12:15
it feels profound. [Piano music]
12:47
It’s a shame it’s not enough.
12:55
The unfortunate reality of debunking Flat Earth is that it’s largely futile, at least for the actual purpose of persuading Flat Earthers.
13:05
This isn’t me saying that we shouldn’t do it, and there are, in fact, a bunch of reasons why we should.
13:11
I mean, first of all, it’s a lot of fun to debunk Flat Earth. Proving that the earth is round is one of those exercises that’s not quite trivial,
13:20
it does take some amount of effort, but it’s not that hard either. It’s in a really sweet spot.
13:27
A lot of it can be done from home with some focused research or spending the time to do the math properly,
13:33
and other experiments just require living near a relatively big lake. And, yeah, we should admit that it’s a lot of fun to debunk a claim like this:
13:42
Another example from Anchorage, Alaska is Mt. McKinley. At 130 miles away on the ball earth the 20,320 foot summit should be leaning away from the observer
13:54
And almost half covered by 9,220 feet of curved earth.
14:00
But just like Mt. Foraker, Mt. McKinley is always seen standing straight up, and visible from base to summit.
14:07
Okay, we know the distance from Anchorage to Denali, it’s 129 miles, which, yes, should create a hidden target height of 9000 feet,
14:16
and Denali should be leaning away from the observer, but earth has a radius of about 3965 miles and Denali is over
14:26
twenty thousand feet tall, so at minimum eleven thousand feet of the mountain should still be visible,
14:32
leaning away from the observer by a trivial 1.8 degrees.
14:37
Like, as a controlled example here are two pyramids in Blender. One of them is leaning away from the camera by one point eight degrees,
14:45
can you tell which one? And the base of the mountain cluster on the Anchorage side
14:51
is forty miles closer to the observer than the peak, and is 1600 feet above sea level.
14:57
So the end result is less of the proportional mass of the mountain is hidden by the curve of the earth than it feels like if you’re just looking at the numbers.
15:06
Also you can’t actually see the true base of the mountain from Anchorage, it just feels like you can because you can see so much of the mountain.
15:15
Plus to get a really good look at the mountain you’re probably going to have to find some higher elevation yourself, just to see over buildings, trees, hills, and other nearby obstructions,
15:24
which will further increase your line of sight over the curve. Like just in this example here, we can see over the tallest buildings in Anchorage, so the photograph was taken from at least 300 feet up.
15:37
Bottom line is you can see Denali from very far away because it’s
15:42
really, really, really, really big,
15:47
and it was the pyramid on the right that was leaning awayv. That’s fun to figure out.
15:54
It’s the same kind of satisfaction you get from solving a math puzzle. Or something like this, claiming that there are no south-pointing compasses,
16:02
that’s a fantastic starter for talking about how we privilege the global north in science in small but consistent ways, via maps or, yes, things like compasses.
16:12
Because, like, every compass is a south-pointing compass, but we don't frame it that way.
16:19
We paint one arm of the compass red and say that that points north
16:24
and we talk abut compasses in those terms, we say that, it's like, oh, this indicates north.
16:30
Even though what it's really doing is it's aligning itself with the directionality of the magnetic field
16:36
So it's indicating both north and south, it's indicating polarity, and points towards both poles simultaneously,
16:46
but that's not the language that we use to describe it. And driving out to the mountains with a trunk full of camera gear,
16:53
spending an afternoon sitting on the shore of a gorgeous lake, that’s just a lot of fun,
16:59
and you get a chance to show everyone something really cool about our world. And sometimes Flat Earthers are just hilarious.
17:08
All the movies about space and all the other movies, they all in some way push that globe model
17:14
The globe, the image of the Beast. Heliocentrism has nothing to do with science!
17:22
The idea that the sun is the centre was thought up by occultists.
17:27
Jesuit priests. The Vatican. It's not, it has nothing to do with science.
17:34
And they say that the earth orbits the sun going 66,600 miles an hour.
17:42
And if you Google how fast does the earth orbit the sun they tell you 18.5 miles per second
17:57
[bong noise] Hold on I'm taking a hit And that’s honestly the frame that most Flat Earth debunking lives within.
18:05
The nonsense claims of Flat Earthers form the starting point of a process of puzzle solving or discussion of geography or a mini lesson in optics,
18:14
because, at the end of the day, Flat Earthers are not available to be persuaded.
18:21
[bell noises] So, we do need to be really careful while we're out here, this is bear country. Not just bear country, this is serious bear country.
18:30
So we got bear bells, we got bear spray, and the thing is that right now we're at the tail end of their fall, like,
18:43
feeding season, when they get really, when they stock up for winter,
18:49
and around the lake and up into a couple of these canyons here is prime growing area for,
18:57
for the bison berries that they, that they eat to do it.
19:04
And at this point we should talk about what Flat Earth is. Like, what Flat Earth really is.
19:11
Nominally Flat Earth is a belief that the earth isn’t a globe, but is actually flat, a fact that has been kept from Us,
19:19
meaning normal people, by a nebulous, powerful Them for nefarious, inscrutable purposes.
19:26
This is where profiles of Flat Earth tend to stop. Which is fair, it’s a reasonable summary for most purposes.
19:33
I want to go beyond that, though, because I think it’s worth considering that the shape of the earth might actually be the least important belief of Flat Earth.
19:43
Flat Earth is a syncretic Biblical belief that is both evangelical and apocalyptic.
19:49
That’s a lot of jargon, what does that mean? Syncretism is effectively a process of creating
19:54
new texts out of the desirable parts of old texts, regardless of the previous relationship between those texts.
20:02
Syncretism is saying two different books both mention dragons or use the word dragon or call an antagonist “The Great Dragon”,
20:09
so they must be referring to the same thing, they’re talking about the exact same Great Dragon,
20:14
and if we cobble together all these different stories of dragons we can uncover the truth about dragons.
20:21
The finger pointing at the now defunct NASA will then turn to finger pointing at the government, who directed the whole thing.
20:29
This is where we run into some dangerous ground involving things like the Arc of the Covenant, the Holy Grail, and the Ring of Power.
20:37
As a syncretic belief system you’ll find all sorts of fragmentary elements lifted from seemingly disconnected and often contradictory sources,
20:45
forced into something resembling agreement, and this spans various legitimate ancient texts as well as modern myths.
20:53
Angels, giants, world trees, and modern conspiracy staples like MK-Ultra,
20:58
the Kennedy assassination, and aliens all have a spot at the table in some corner or another.
21:28
Additionally support will be teased out of nearly any sacred text that is sufficiently mythological or abstract,
21:35
such that it can be stripped of context or interpreted hyper-literally or in some way be made to agree with the construction of their reality.
22:02
Also I should note that I’m specifically framing this as a syncretic Biblical belief,
22:07
not strictly Christian, because while the modern Flat Earth movement clearly has deep roots in the social and lexical traditions of American Christianity,
22:17
the actual theological doctrines of Christianity are largely absent or secularized.
22:23
While the Bible is a core text, and many Flat Earth evangelists are unambiguously Christian,
22:29
the wider Flat Earth movement is largely only interested in the parts concerning the creation and end of the world.
22:37
In essence modern Flat Earth is an offshoot of Christianity where Jesus is a secondary figure and the primary theological concern is the true
22:46
nature of the physical world, its origin, and its destiny. But, also, all that lives side by side with pop culture Egyptology,
22:55
mystical Gnosticism, and, I dunno what you’d call it, esoteric fictionalism,
23:03
this belief that the fantastical worlds of pop culture are a warped or
23:09
coded reflection of the true world.
23:20
It’s chaotic and inconsistent because there is no central authority, no unique unifying texts, so you’ll find different commentators that take
23:29
any given point to more or less extreme conclusions, which can make it difficult to talk about the movement as a whole, but there are elements
23:38
that remain consistent across the field of Flat Earth texts. The world is flat and “they” are hiding that fact from you because a
23:46
Flat Earth would be irrefutable proof that we live in a divine fishbowl, and thus god is real.
23:53
This is important because, again, they are evangelical and apocalyptic. This means, first, that orthodoxy is considered a spiritual necessity,
24:02
that there is a universal divine moral right and wrong, and all are held to account for the rightness of their beliefs.
24:09
As a result it is the imperative of the believers to make sure as many people are believers as possible because there are consequences for not believing.
24:19
To be clear, and I can't stress this enough, do not start conversations with the word 'flat earth'
24:28
You may note, already, that this is clearly setting up an adversarial relationship between Flat Earthers and everyone else, as anyone who denies
24:37
Flat Earth or works to debunk it is not just presenting alternative evidence
24:42
of the way the world works, but is impeding proof of god. The second critical meaning is a belief that there is an impending
24:50
literal end to the world. This end will occur at some unknown point in the future,
24:55
but that point is always “soon”. Many Flat Earthers subscribe to the pop culture version of a Biblical apocalypse,
25:02
but it doesn’t actually feature very heavily for the most part, with most skipping past the details to the part where god shows up and proves they're right.
25:13
It is difficult to understate the impact on long term planning, the support for policies and politicians,
25:19
that comes from the belief that at some point in the next generation or two God will just personally show up and wrap up humanity,
25:27
like a board game being packed back into its box. A critical component of Flat Earth’s worldview is the baked-in idea of opposition.
25:35
The enemy, the “them”, isn’t merely another group with a different idea of what’s best for the world, or a different set of motivations
25:43
that may or may not intersect with the wellbeing of others, they are actively seeking harm.
25:49
This is, in a way, the immune response of paranoid conspiratorial thought. It creates an impenetrable counter to any conflict.
25:57
Any disagreement, any counter-argument, is clearly manufactured by an opposition
26:02
that isn’t merely indifferent to truth, but actively, knowingly suppressing it.
26:09
I wanted to take a look at this dimension of Flat Earth because two of my peers and friends, H.bomberguy and Philosophy Tube, have done videos on Flat Earth
26:17
and while I don’t think they are wrong, I think their assessment of Flat Earth is incomplete.
26:24
Both of their videos function, like many others, by taking Flat Earth as a jumping off point
26:29
to discuss intersecting concepts of philosophy and science and sociology, and that’s great.
26:36
They’re good videos. The idea that Philosophy Tube brings up, that discussions of science are a rhetorical exercise,
26:42
influenced by the social context that they are had within, and the idea that Flat Earthers are unpersuaded by conventional rhetoric,
26:52
or perhaps persuaded into Flat Earth by unconventional rhetoric, is one that we have grappled with in making this,
27:00
it is an extremely relevant concept. None of those have anything whatsoever to do with the
27:05
evidence they just all note a failure to be rhetorically persuaded
27:11
Harry goes to great lengths to give Flat Earthers the benefit of the doubt, carefully isolating the very specific belief that that world is flat
27:20
and addressing the anxieties that specifically, narrowly come up with the ontology of the physical world.
27:27
you're right to feel that something is wrong
27:33
because something is wrong just maybe keep looking for the source of what that thing is because
27:39
the earth is not flat. On the surface Flat Earthers share many of the same anxieties as the rest of us:
27:45
they are worried about the power structures that have immense influence over our lives, the systems that shape the information we have access to,
27:54
and the shared fictions that society operates on like money and rent.
28:00
But there is, perhaps, an over-willingness to treat them as harmless cranks, as though we can start from their shared frustrations with the world,
28:08
and just gently nudge them in a more sensible direction. These common anxieties are a shared coordinate that is, I think,
28:16
far more superficial than we would want it to be, because while we’re all worried and skeptical of what people in power are doing,
28:25
Flat Earthers have very, very different ideas about who’s in power and what they’re trying to do with it.
28:32
Flat Earthers are not otherwise empty vessels who believe one kooky thing.
28:37
They believe that thing because it suits their purposes. Flat Earthers have an agenda.
28:44
The end goal of conspiratorial beliefs is to simplify reality by attributing the high-chaos state of the world to a
28:51
singular active force or group opposed by an equally singular solution. indoctrination is the way they run this
28:58
world it's the way that they keep their lie going it's the way that they have passed their
29:03
lie along as science when it is nothing more than a belief they have a biased foundation built on a
29:09
lie and now they know they're stuck Their anxiety is that the world has become too complex,
29:14
that too many things are changing, and that science and progressivism are actively malicious elements
29:20
working to obstruct the true nature of god. Most people don’t actually believe Flat Earth because they were persuaded by shoddy evidence,
29:28
or they found other evidence to be less persuasive about the nature of the physical world, they do so because it says something they already believe about the nature of the social world.
29:41
Flat Earth is a thing people want to believe because if it were true it would be irrefutable proof of everything else they believe.
29:50
Flat Earth is a system that selectively delegitimizes power structures and does so by working backwards.
29:56
Flat Earth insists that you are being lied to by “them”, typically gays, liberals, or jews,
30:02
in order to obfuscate the existence of God and are thus not merely an opponent of their isolationist, xenophobic policies but an enemy of righteousness itself.
30:14
heliocentrism is simply modern day sun worship masquerading as a science
30:20
They are not trying to explain the world, they are attempting to un-explain it,
30:26
because those explanations, the real explanations, have become inconvenient to their politics.
30:33
And while there is a shared sense of the world being out of whack, the diagnosis and prescriptions are very different.
30:42
I don’t think it’s actually possible to isolate Flat Earth from the reactionary current that it swims in and,
30:48
I dunno, for some reason in 2020 I’ve found myself with a lot less patience for
30:54
people who engage in performative rejection of empathy and evidence. On that note, who wants to guess how Flat Earthers feel about COVID masks?
31:02
anyone that is voluntarily wearing a mask at this stage
31:07
is a mindless drone who couldn't think for themselves if their life depended on it
31:13
The deeper, more critical issue is in the information landscape that has given rise to new faith movements like Flat Earth.
31:20
We are in an extremely low-trust media environment as a product of decades of active sabotage combined with a corporate,
31:28
capitalist environment that prioritizes the interests of the wealthy or blindly pursues metric-driven success models like “engagement”.
31:36
There are a lot of legitimate reasons to distrust the media, to see them as at-best spineless
31:42
in the face of disinformation or as outright collaborators and profiteers. The prevalence of legitimate reasons for distrust, legitimate anxieties for the future,
31:52
creates an ideal environment for groups like Flat Earth who peddle a simplistic Us vs. Them model of the universe.
32:00
so a couple days ago i'm tracking down some uh
32:06
flat earth stuff and i find myself watching a live stream a flat earth live stream
32:13
that's mostly um they're just watching basically reruns
32:19
of conference videos and and other stuff and other flat earth
32:24
stuff and i i make the mistake of uh talking in chat
32:31
that i mentioned this experiment that i did and i don't you know come in as
32:38
as a like aggressive disbeliever but i'm like hey so like the video that we were watching
32:44
the video that they were watching was one where the guy says like okay like there's these
32:51
experiments you can do like you can try these yourself and you can get the results and you can see the
32:57
results you can see that there is no curve so i'm like hey a couple weeks ago
33:08
i went out to a really really big lake and i did this test you know i
33:16
i replicated these tests that they're saying to do
33:22
and you know like boats and the far shore disappeared behind the curve.
33:28
and and they say oh well you know it must have been it must have been big you know water
33:35
swells it was it was swells in the waves and i'm like nah this is a
33:42
this is a long lake but it's not a big lake like this the water was like really calm you know there were
33:50
no swells and they're like well you know boats aren't that big they can they can hide themselves in their own wake
33:56
i'm like well no this is like a tour boat it's like four meters tall and and we go through like kind of a
34:04
bunch of other things where they're just like oh well was it this and and it was all stuff that i had controlled for
34:09
it was all stuff that i had anticipated and factored in and the one guy
34:16
is just like well you must have done it wrong you did
34:21
something wrong pray about it and do it again
34:30
And I think it's just like you just told me to pray the curve away
34:36
Okay, so, how did Flat Earth actually gain traction? Like, okay, there’s a lot of different conspiracy theories out there, there’s a lot of worldviews,
34:45
both legitimate and scams, that have the same “you have been lied to” pitch. So why Flat Earth?
34:53
Modern Flat Earth was essentially created by content algorithms trying to maximize retention and engagement by serving users suggestions for things that are,
35:02
effectively, incrementally more concentrated versions of the thing they were already looking at.
35:08
Bizarre cranks peddling random theories are an aspect of civilization that has always been with us,
35:14
so it was inevitable that they would end up on YouTube, but the algorithm made sure they found an audience.
35:21
These systems were accidentally identifying people susceptible to conspiratorial
35:26
and reactionary thinking and sending them increasingly deeper into Flat Earth evangelism.
35:32
And within that was just a quirk of good timing, I guess. The right cranks were churning out huge volumes of low-effort content at just the right time for YouTube
35:41
to prioritize it, and the moment it gained any traction at all the system reinforced that success.
35:48
But, you know, let’s keep some perspective here. Flat Earth, for all the command it holds over our collective interest,
35:55
is still a very small movement. The largest channels cap out around 150,000 subscribers, with most coming in well below that.
36:05
and this is not much in the scope of YouTube where the opportunity cost of subscription is extremely low,
36:12
and for the last couple years newer pro-flat-earth videos from these channels have mostly been skating by with a few thousand views.
36:22
In fact Mark Sargent, the guy largely credited with popularizing Flat Earth in the YouTube era, his videos used to get hundreds of thousands of views.
36:31
His seminal work, Flat Earth Clues, has 1.1 million views. But he’s only had two videos break six digits since the start of 2018:
36:41
one that’s just a bootleg repost of Shane Dawson’s Flat Earth video, and one whinging about The Last Jedi.
36:48
Now, YouTube, notably, has made some changes to the algorithm to prioritize credible sources,
36:54
which lowers the ranking of Flat Earth videos even within their own sphere, but those changes were only implemented in early 2019 when Flat Earth was already on a downslope.
37:06
More impactfully, whether it’s debunking or merely profiling, mainstream channels talking about Flat Earth from an external perspective are just
37:16
vastly more popular than actual Flat Earth content. So if you’re watching Flat Earth videos you are far, far more likely to be recommended
37:24
mainstream videos with millions of views over evangelist videos with hundreds.
37:30
The bottom line is that Flat Earth has been slowly bleeding support for the last several years.
37:36
Because they’re all going to QAnon. [Peppy music]
Part 2
37:55
QAnon is a fascist Biblical esoteric apocalypse cult that believes an anonymous government agent
38:01
known only as Q is leaking sensitive “above top secret” information to ""Patriots”
38:07
revealing that the political and cultural opponents of Donald J. Trump, the so-called “Deep State” and “Hollywood elite”, are the minions of “The Cabal”,
38:16
literal Satan-worshipping pedophiles who kidnap, traffic, molest, and terrorize children
38:21
in order to produce and harvest adrenochrome (a byproduct of the body processing adrenaline)
38:27
which they use to get high during the ritual worship of their lord, who is, again, Satan;
38:33
a constructed enemy so cartoonishly evil that it justifies discarding basically all human rights
38:39
in order to turn opposition to Trump into a crime in a sweeping authoritarian purge of undesirables and political opponents called The Storm that will usher in a
38:48
golden age of peace and prosperity, or The Great Awakening. Q has put out there that many high level officials will soon be arrested,
38:58
and it will actually be the Drain The Swamp scenario that we have, that we have always been wanting to happen.
39:05
He says that once the corruption and the type of corruption is revealed to the American people, it will trigger something he calls The Awakening
39:14
He says it will be like an event, something that we've never witnessed in American history
39:20
But it will, it will cause Americans to unite behind President Trump and his administration in order to completely clean house.
39:28
Okay, you guys, if that happens, we will be so happy I see all those hearts and I love it
39:34
If that happens we will be so happy, um, I really truly pray that this is true.
39:39
And that’s not even getting into the co-morbid Pizzagate myth of hidden pedophile pizza-shop sex dungeons that has led many followers to see any visual depiction of pizza,
39:49
the famous and popular food, as subliminal code marking the outlines of this vast conspiracy.
39:55
Look at this, what's on his back, y'all
40:04
Like, if Flat Earth is simply anxious for the end of the world, QAnon is a straight up do","Clickbait Title: The Twist at 37 Minutes Will Make You Believe We Live In Hell

The Strange Reality of Roller Coaster Tycoon,"1,383,521","55,000",7/19/20,18:11,"0:09
There is at least one roller coaster designed specifically to kill you.
0:15
It was never built, it was never in consideration for construction.
0:19
But that doesn’t mean it isn’t fascinating.
0:24
Blueprinted by Julijonas Urbonas, the “Euthanasia Coaster” is one massive climb, followed
0:30
by a series of increasingly tight loops.
0:33
The ride, once the top of the hill is reached, lasts about one minute, during which the rider
0:39
experiences 10Gs, loses consciousness, and ultimately dies due to a sustained lack of
0:45
oxygen to the brain.
0:48
Urbonas does not consider his coaster a cruelty, or a machine designed for executions.
0:54
Instead, the 1600-foot tall monolith is envisioned as a more meaningful encounter with death
1:01
than traditional medical euthanasia methods.
1:04
“the procedures of terminating a patient’s life are highly hospitalised and not much
1:09
different from the mundane injection of medicine.
1:12
There is no special ritual nor is death given any special meaning apart from the legal procedures
1:17
and psychological preparation.
1:21
It is as if death is divorced from our cultural life just as death rituals are in our secular
1:27
and postmodern Western society.
1:28
But if it is already legal, why not make it more meaningful...as a ritual adapted to the
1:34
contemporary world”
1:38
Urbonas repeatedly describes his design as euphoric, the thin strands of the track as
1:45
beautiful, and the experience of death as both intentional and dignified compared to
1:50
our current methods.
1:52
He also acknowledges its potential as both horror and black comedy; there’s even a
1:57
short film based on the idea, with interesting, if not quite as profound, results.
2:03
But, judging on the number of times the coaster has been featured on the front page of reddit,
2:08
how many articles and thinkpieces have already been written about it, there’s an energy
2:12
here that truly captures the imagination.
2:14
I think it’s the physicality.
2:18
Not as detached as an injection, not as fast as a firing squad, not as invisible as an
2:23
electric chair.
2:25
The ride is eminently conceivable while simultaneously leading to something beyond our comprehension.
2:32
And it is also, absent of context, simply a beautiful design.
2:41
There is, actually, another roller coaster designed to kill you, although it lacks some
2:46
of Urbonas’ elegance.
2:48
It was made by an anonymous forum user in the game Roller Coaster Tycoon 2, and it’s
2:54
called “Mr. Bones’ Wild Ride.”
2:57
While the euthanasia coaster is a minute of oxygen-depriving force, Mr. Bones’ Wild
3:03
Ride is, by contrast, lethally slow.
3:07
It’s a 31,000 foot track that riders practically crawl through, confined to their cars while
3:14
four in-game years pass.
3:16
At the end, since the game’s simulated guests don’t experience starvation or decomposition,
3:22
they’re fittingly dumped right back in line for the ride.
3:27
As well known as Urbonas’ design is, he might be beat by this track’s lasting legacy-
3:32
not the design itself, but the only thought present in its riders’ minds:
3:38
“I want to get off Mr. Bones Wild Ride”
3:43
I, too, have created lethal virtual rollercoasters, though it was rarely intentional.
3:53
Instead, my crushing g-forces and my cars that left their rails behind were due to my
3:58
complete non-understanding of physics, rather than my poetic utilization of it.
4:04
But I still found myself weirdly transfixed by this game, Roller Coaster Tycoon.
4:10
True story, once the mayor of my city came to visit our elementary school class and asked
4:16
everyone what they wanted to be when they grew up.
4:18
I proudly answered “a theme park designer!,” although I’m not sure I had even been to
4:25
one at that point.
4:27
My obsession comes back, as I mentioned with the Urbonas, to physicality.
4:33
Theme park rides, especially roller coasters, have this interesting distinction of being
4:37
some of the most visible engineering many of us ever see.
4:42
You might see a building scaffold go up, but it's quickly replaced by smooth facades, glass
4:46
and brick and metal.
4:48
But a coaster is nothing but scaffolding, it is absolutely raw in its design, as if
4:54
challenging you to confront the fact that it’s as much a piece of machinery as it
4:59
is a...luxury entertainment mechanism.
5:06
Rarely are we met with the realities of what steel can do more than when staring up at
5:11
one of these twisting, corkscrewing colossuses.
5:15
And don’t even get me started on wooden coasters, so absolutely packed with struts
5:19
and supports that it seems that your ride through it is almost an afterthought.
5:24
A quick side-story: when I was a kid, back when I was declaring my intentions to be a
5:29
theme park designer, I had never really been on a roller coaster.
5:35
Not a big deal, I thought.
5:36
I know I like em.
5:38
My first chance to test this theory was the “thunderhead” coaster at Dollywood, a
5:42
real park themed around legendary country singer Dolly Parton.
5:50
Yep.
5:54
The South is weird, y’all.
5:57
I began to regret my decision before we could even see the cars.
6:01
Just the line snaking under what felt like hundreds of tons of wooden boards, all being
6:06
shaken by the ride above, was enough to seriously spook me.
6:10
If my dad wasn’t with me and (gently) pressuring me to stay, there’s absolutely no way I
6:17
would have climbed into that seat.
6:19
We had to get the picture though.
6:21
It was just too good.
6:27
Despite the fact that Roller Coaster Tycoon is graphically primitive compared to what
6:32
we’re capable of now, it absolutely sells that level of design.
6:38
Part of it comes from how visually dense the coasters themselves are.
6:42
Put a carousel or a pirate ship somewhere, and it’s a fun novelty landmark.
6:46
Put a coaster down and it dominates the landscape.
6:51
It will block off sightlines, it will deform the ground.
6:56
Some of the high-tech steel designs may leave some light between their supports; a wooden
7:00
coaster might as well be a brick wall.
7:03
They’re also just freaking huge, they are catastrophically big.
7:08
They are not something you can just squeeze into a corner, dropping one means basically
7:14
a change to the layout of an entire park.
7:18
This is one way in which RCT feels far more realistic than something like SimCity.
7:23
In a citybuilder, I can basically drop a skyscraper wherever I want.
7:28
In Tycoon, every square foot matters.
7:32
One of my favorite demonstrations of this is a scenario in which you literally have
7:36
unlimited money, but the terrain is so extreme and the existing park so tight that all the
7:42
money in the world doesn’t help if you don’t have an understanding of how to maneuver the
7:46
rolls and curves of your coaster around the land.
7:51
And guess what?
7:53
I don’t!
7:55
I have played enough of this game to know that I absolutely do not have that understanding,
8:01
I don’t have the elegance, I don’t have the chops.
8:05
My go-to move when building a coaster was always to go as high as possible, do a giant
8:10
drop, a few spins, and then desperately try to connect it back to the start.
8:14
What this was taught me was: Even trying to accomplish a task as simple
8:19
as a closed-circuit track was WAY harder than it looks.
8:23
There are certain ways tracks just can’t bend, you need to accommodate the realities
8:28
of the material you’re working with, and the cars that will ride on top of it.
8:33
You need to accommodate the realities of the materials riding inside the cars- that is,
8:39
people.
8:40
I can’t tell you how many times I pulled and prodded a track into a shape that was
8:44
finally complete, only to test it and have the results tell me it somehow has an intensity
8:50
of 15 with a excitement of 1??
8:52
How is that even possible?
8:54
Its 7 Gs???
8:55
Move over, Urbonas, I’ve got my own death coaster right here.
8:59
(also, as a reminder, this was the kid who wanted to design theme parks.
9:04
This one).
9:06
That difficulty only increased my respect for the genuine article though, only made
9:11
it seem more impossible that these rides run as safely and smoothly as they do.
9:16
They don’t, for the most part, have secret tricks.
9:19
They stand there, confrontational, everything out in the open.
9:23
They are, again, confrontational- like they’re saying, “what, you think something’s going
9:26
to surprise you?
9:28
It’s all right here.
9:29
It’s a horror movie except I’m telling you exactly where all the scares will be,
9:34
and you’re still afraid?”
9:37
(yes).
9:39
And there is, not-so-coincidentally, a parallel to the actual construction of Roller Coaster
9:45
Tycoon here.
9:46
Chris Sawyer, the father of the series, did his homework, visited dozens of parks, rode
9:52
the rides, all that.
9:53
But he did more than that- he built the game itself like a roller coaster.
10:01
In video game writing, a game being like a roller coaster typically means exciting, bombastic,
10:06
linear.
10:07
I don’t mean that here.
10:09
I mean in its bones, Roller Coaster Tycoon is an exposed framework of code, as imposing
10:16
and confrontational as the rides themselves.
10:20
Because RCT is written in ~Assembly~.
10:23
There’s an interview on PCGamesN with Chris Sawyer called “RollerCoaster Tycoon: the
10:30
best-optimised game of all time?”
10:33
This is a weird headline- we don’t usually sell games on optimization, it’s not really
10:38
what drives the clicks.
10:40
But in this case, I totally get it.
10:43
Assembly, the coding language I referred to earlier, is not a game engine.
10:48
It’s not even as user-friendly as something like Java; it’s closer to the literal language
10:53
computers think in.
10:56
Think of it this way.
10:57
When you design a game in Unity, that engine is giving tools to developers to make it easier
11:02
to work with.
11:03
Those tools make it easier to create everything we expect a game to have.
11:06
But then, when running that game, there’s a process of reverse-translation: Unity has
11:12
to tell the computer what those tools mean.
11:16
Computers don’t think like we do, and so we make engines to present things to us in
11:21
terms we understand, we abstract the 1s and 0s into something more palatable.
11:26
A good chunk of a computer’s processing power is figuring out how to undo that abstraction.
11:33
So, to write an entire game in assembly means that there’s almost no work the computer
11:39
needs to do to un-abstract the thing.
11:42
It’s all right there, right in the open, and that means that Roller Coaster Tycoon
11:49
would have been an absolute monster to program, but it also means that it could probably run
11:55
on your graphing calculator.
11:57
Do you see what I’m saying here?
12:00
Sawyer somehow took the sparseness of a coaster’s design, the form-is-function aesthetic, and
12:06
used that same principle to make a game about roller coasters.
12:12
There is no abstraction to bog us down here, nothing to slow the experience, just pure
12:17
undiluted engineering.
12:20
It kicks ass.
12:24
Urbonas describes his euthanasia coaster, as it exists now, as “polyreal,” not confined
12:31
to just one plane of existence.
12:34
The coaster itself is not an ethical, legal, moral statement; it exists, in theory.
12:41
It would function, if one was ever built.
12:43
It’s us that impart the meaning onto it.
12:47
“Euthanasia Coaster as a social fiction design is an incomplete story, as it is actually
12:54
a functional design proposal for a killer coaster: just an engineered falling trajectory.
12:59
Thus, such design is capable of existing in several realities at once…[that] are neither
13:04
here nor there, but are simultaneously material and mental.”
13:11
As galaxy-brain as this sounds, it’s actually precisely how I feel about the strangely legitimate-feeling
13:18
parks of Roller Coaster Tycoon 2.
13:21
It’s just a game; a 20-year-old game at that, with all the graphical limitations and
13:26
abstracted systems inherent to its age.
13:30
But still- when I played Zelda, I didn’t decide to be an adventurer.
13:35
When I played Lego Island 2, I didn’t tell the mayor I wanted to be a pizza delivery
13:39
guy.
13:40
There’s a realness in these pixels, pulled from the punishing physics and spatial realities
13:46
hard-coded into this game.
13:49
My 600-foot-tall unrideable g-force killer will never exist in real life.
13:55
Neither will Mr. Bones’ Wild Ride, nor the Euthanasia Coaster.
14:00
All of these are functionally just thought experiments (with wildly varying levels of
14:05
prestige).
14:07
And yet, they’re still wonderfully confrontational, just like their real-life counterparts.
14:12
They’re bare, exposed, harsh pieces of design.
14:17
One of my favorite things to do in Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 is just to pull the camera
14:22
back.
14:23
It can start so close, you can see individual people making decisions, eating food, laughing
14:28
with delight.
14:30
One click back reveals the patterns in their movement, the way they’re shaped by the
14:34
footpaths and rides and their own automated desires.
14:38
One more, and the crowd sounds mix with the music, each ride’s little jingle overlapping
14:43
with its neighbors.
14:45
But you can keep going back, and back, and back, until the crowd, the music, everything
14:51
else has just fallen away.
14:54
What you’re left with is just those great hills and drops and turns, far outstripping
15:00
everything around them, reaching towards an isometric sky.
15:06
Whoaa!
15:08
Whoaaa!
15:10
Oh sorry, I didn’t see you there- I was just watching a documentary from this video’s
15:22

CATS & The Weird Mind of TS Eliot | An Analysis,"334,188","16,000",3/24/20,58:50,"0:12
the speaking on eliot is a difficult matter, for hes long and gone and cant pen a
0:17
rebuttal and being a cat should my opinion even matter? Though he made claims about us that werent even subtle
0:25
were white and were black, and were medium-sized? Were three named and blind and possess jeweled eyes
0:32
but did eliot ask a cat, how we self-identify? Did he watch us from windows and then just surmise
0:38
i am a cat, and i have but one name; and all of them mine, not for human eyes
0:44
and if eliot so boldly laid us to claim; allow a cat to rebuttal with my thoughts on
0:50
his lies. Yeah, i have a lot to say about cats, but i cant say i didnt enjoy it, somehow.
1:03
cats is a movie about anthropomorphic cat people who are constantly aroused. Its
1:09
a movie about a highly stratified, very traditional feline society, which also happens to be a
1:15
ritualistic death cult, meow. Its a movie that defies visual description with uncanny computer generated effects, bizarre
1:21
body movement, and distracting camera work. So the 2019 version of cats is the story of
1:27
a very ordered society, told in the most jarring way imaginable. Spoiler alert! Although i think spoiling this movie is kind of impossible. Its like spoiling
1:37
a psychedelic mushroom trip. But what little plot there is involves a group of cats coming together for something called the jellicle ball, which is a talent show where the winner--chosen
1:46
by old deuteronomy--will die and be reborn. Confused? Dont worry, i watched both the
1:52
1998 dvd version, and the 2019 theatrical version multiple times, and im still confused.
1:58
cats is also based on the poetry of the godfather of modern poetry, ts eliot. Most of the lyrics
2:04
are derived from old possums book of practical cats, which is full of childrens poetry
2:09
that eliot wrote to his younger relatives, then compiled for publication in 1939. Old possums book of practical cats fits into a subgenre of children's book that detail
2:19
the physical and personality traits of different races. It does for cats what a book like bozo
2:25
and his rocket ship did for humans, which was published in the 40s. It assigned stereotypical,
2:31
cartoonish traits to various human cultures around the world. Books like this were designed to teach kids that different types of people fit into different, predefined categories.
2:41
or to put it more bluntly: theyre designed to teach harmful racist stereotypes to children. Meow.
2:47
speaking of old school racism and institutionalized violence, ts eliot also happened to be a fascist
2:52
sympathizer. He did reject the label fascist, but dont get me wrong: he didnt reject
2:58
fascism in favor of anti-fascism. Instead, eliot labelled himself a royalist. He
3:03
was a devout christian and identified as anglo-catholic. Which is an ultra conservative movement that
3:09
argued for the supreme authority for the church of england. Eliot did not believe in the separation of church and state, but rather the superiority over the state. Between his royalim and anglican
3:20
faith, eliot believed that kings are literally chosen by god to lead a country. In eliots brand of royalist thinking, the body of the king represents both the human
3:29
manifestation of god on earth, and the personification of the state. The king is the head of
3:35
state, to the metaphorical body politic. Even today, the british monarch holds the title
3:40
supreme governor of the church of england, and the canon law of the church of england states: we acknowledge that the queen's most excellent majesty, acting according to
3:49
the laws of the realm, is the highest power under god in this kingdom, and has supreme authority over all persons in all causes, as well ecclesiastical as civil. And here
3:59
in america, theres a terrifying and indisputable rise in royalism and christian dominionism.
4:05
the idea of democracy offended ts eliot, since democracy implies that everyone has basic
4:11
human rights, and that everyone deserves a say in politics. He was a big fan of charles
4:16
murras, the anti-semitic, anti-parliamentarist philosopher, who happens to be a hero of steve
4:22
bannon. Eliot was also buddies with countless awful people. Like wyndham lewis who described
4:27
hitler as a man of peace. Of course, eliot wasnt just a fan of antisemites. He was also a vocal anti semite himself, often saying things that sound like they couldve
4:38
been pulled straight from a richard spencer blog post. In his lecture series after strange gods he outlined what he thought was the right way to organize society: that being, a bunch
4:48
of ethno-nationalist states where race-mixing is not allowed, and everyone is segregated
4:53
by race and religion: the population should be homogeneous; where two or more cultures
4:59
exist in the same place they are likely either to be fiercely self-conscious or both to become
5:05
adulterate. What is still more important is unity of religious background; and reasons
5:11
of race and religion combine to make any large number of free-thinking jews undesirable.
5:18
and on whether hed be okay with those ethno-states tolerating each other, he continues: [a]
5:25
spirit of excessive tolerance is to be deprecated. (p19-20) when it comes to bigotry, eliot showed
5:31
what we in the 21st century would call his whole ass. In eliots worldview, you are merely a cell within the larger organism that is the kings
5:40
body that we call society. And if that body gets sick how does royalism respond?
5:45
well, in 1988, prince philip, husband of queen elizabeth, said this: in the event that i am reincarnated i would like to return as a deadly virus, to contribute something to
5:55
solving overpopulation. The goal of royalism will always be for the king to hold the power.
6:01
democracys end goal is for the people to hold the power. Facism uses the mass appeal of a popular movement like democracy, to achieve its end goal of a dictator holding power.
6:13
fascism is just royalism with a little thing we millenials like to call, a rebrand. Love
6:18
a good rebrand! Ahh! The overlap between royalists and fascist-leaning conservatives in the united states has been
6:25
present in conservative propaganda since forever. From donald trump joking about never
6:32
stepping down from the presidency, to liberty hangout, the group that gun girl is a part of tweeting this: it is far more preferable to live under a monarchy than a democracy.
6:43
democracy is mob rule of the government estate, and is a soft form of communism, to the
6:49
dedication to ann coulters 1998 book high crimes and misdemeanors: the case against
6:54
bill clinton, where she wrote: to my parents, who see virtues in the british system.
6:59
okayyy... In todays political terms, eliot would align with the christian far right, have a
7:06
photo of thanos on his twitter, and his own column in quillette, where hed compare celebrity skull shapes. Yes, eliot may have wanted a king, rather than a fascist dictator.
7:17
but whether you call your tyrant your majesty, or mein fuhrer, or the queen mum,
7:23
what difference does it make to the people who are oppressed by that regime? So its no coincidence that cats contains a hell of a lot of fascist imagery and ideology,
7:32
but like, for kids! To start, lets compare cats to umberto ecos essay ur fascism
7:38
where he laid out fourteen properties associated with fascist ideology. He argues that only
7:43
one of these needs to be present for facist ideology to thrive. Most obviously, theres
7:48
the whole death cult thing, where death is ritualized and glorified, with the promise of rebirth. Fascist leaders encourage the masses to seek out death through military
7:57
service or stocastic terrorism. Veryyy fashy. Theres the cult of tradition as a means of denying progress in favor of reinforcing
8:05
old power structures. Instead of using the scientific method to discover new knowledge,
8:10
or using rational thought to arrive at reasonable conclusions, the cult of tradition demands
8:15
that you look back to the past for all the answers. According to umberto eco: [t]here can be no advancement of learning. Truth has been already spelled out once and for all,
8:24
and we can only keep interpreting its obscure message. Much like the jellicle ball, whose message is, if anything,... Obscure.
8:32
up up up up to the heaviside layer.
8:37
theres popular elitism which argues that we the people are the chosen people.
8:43
i believe you truly are a jellicle cat. Ah yes, the jellicle cats, much more important than... All of the other cats.
8:53
we also see the characterization of old deuteronomy as the patriarch, or in the case of the movie
8:59
its a matriarch, but with exactly the same power and assumption of absolute privilege am i saying that cats is inherently fascist? No. Am i saying that tom hooper, director
9:10
of the 2019 cats is a fascist? No. Am i saying andrew lloyd webber, the writer and producer
9:17
of cats, is a fascist? No, at least not provably. I am saying that both versions of cats are based on writings by an extreme bigot and
9:26
elements of his bigotry and his fascist sympathies are undeniably folded into the meaning of the play and therefore film. The original poems contained child-friendly, sanitized
9:36
versions of eliots beliefs, and the play and musical sanitize them even further, even
9:41
if theyre unrecognizable at first glance. So, more importantly for us the audience: is it okay to enjoy cats, considering its
9:49
problematic origins and the fashy ideas behind it? Well, first off, a lot of the songs f--ing
9:55
slap, and thats always good. But what i really like about cats the stage musical--despite its fascist-inspired origins, and its weirdly ritualized death cult--is: watching these
10:05
incredible dancers, actors and singers come together in a performance that celebrates the human body and what its capable of, feels... Really liberating.
10:14
its an example of content being in conflict with style. The style of the original stage play was already at direct odds with eliots fashy beliefs, and i loved it. And now, the
10:26
2019 version, eliots ideas are another step removed, this time extra, extra removed
10:33
thanks to the hyper-alienating cgi and bad costumes. The result is a movie so abstracted,
10:39
so inane, so unrelatable, even though its terrible, and at times boring, its a kind of accidental parody of those same fashy beliefs. And the best movie to watch when youre
10:48
coming down from a mushroom trip. Or maybe the worst, ill get back to you on that. This liberating feeling i get from cats emerges from that conflict between the original source
10:57
material and the 1998 play version: the tension between the plays stuffy, fascist origins,
11:03
and the weird, kinetic dancing that celebrates the human body. And im legally allowed to speak on this because i got an a+ in modern dance
11:11
class which, yes, was a prerequisite in college and yes, was also the only dance class i took in college. So.
11:18
theres two reasons i love the dancing. First, i like the dancing and body language for its own sake. Body language is heavily
11:26
policed in our society. Restricting our body language is one of the first ways that were conditioned by society to behave, to fit in, and to signify our class. Many of
11:36
the first rules we learn as children dictate the way we sit, stand, and move through a room. Youre told to sit still, and not just told to sit still, but told how to
11:45
sit still. Every aspect of our body language gets critiqued, not only by adults, but by our peers too.
11:50
even the way you throw a ball can be characterized as throwing like a girl. We assign gender markers to actions that have nothing to do with gender or sex, and then we restrict those
11:59
actions to specific groups. What we are allowed to express with our body language depends on our status in society. Even the way that we look at someone else can be considered
12:08
offensive. Just think back to when you were a kid, and adults would threaten you: dont you dare give me that look.
12:14
the cats fluid, expressive body movements break free from those constraints. Their bodies
12:20
become a means of expressing emotion, rather than an object that contains your emotions.
12:26
thats what i love about dance in general. In fact, the reason i got an a+ in my modern dance class was because i had no formal dance
12:34
training. Other students, who had grown up perfecting ballet poses and difficult tap dancing configurations, had a lot of trouble unlearning those more rigid body movements.
12:43
i had no trouble because i was terrible at regular dancing. So terrible in fact i was
12:48
laughed out of the general dance audition a month before. This modern dance class was the first time i didnt feel like a total failure because i hadnt attended a private
12:58
arts high school. I did, however, play a lot of sports in high school and my modern dance teacher effing
13:04
loved it. Our teacher would be like move across the floor any way you want! And
13:09
that freedom was difficult for a lot of people to deal with, since this was supposed to be a dance class. It was honestly just pure luck that our teacher loved my skinny chicken arms
13:19
and i couldnt pierrette to save my life, but she was a brilliant modern dance teacher who instilled in me this idea of unlearning the right way to move. The right
13:28
way to be. And learning that every muscle, every gesture--no matter how unconventional--could
13:34
be used to express something. Modern dance offers a type of freedom that personally spoke to me, and when i see cats on stage i am amazed by the beautiful ballet and tap choreography,
13:45
as well as the moments when it honors weird body movements that remind us there is no right way to be.
13:51
and secondly, i love the dancing because ts eliot wouldve hated the dancing. Eliot was very concerned with the decline of cis, heterosexual culture. His most famous
14:00
poems all deal with his fear that men were turning into soy boys, which might give you
14:05
the impression that ts eliot was a chad. But the reality as far as i can tell is that he was pretty meek. He wore pale makeup so he would look more like a corpse, which i
14:15
guess made him some sort of conservative goth. He was terrified of women, even just the sight of a woman. His biography on ts eliot dot com notes that when he was at oxford, if a
14:25
female student walked into the same room as him, he couldnt even look at her. If seeing a woman enter a classroom was upsetting enough to make him turn away, im pretty sure watching
14:35
this... Wouldve made him spontaneously combust.
14:47
when eliot finally did marry his first wife vivenne, it was a disaster. Vivenne and eliots
14:52
friend bertrand russell had an affair behind eliots back, and eliot eventually committed vivenne to a mental hospital against her will until she died. When he was 68 he remarried
15:03
his 30 year old secretary meow. The more of eliots poetry you read, and the more you
15:09
read about his sex life, the more you realize he was a miserable curmudgeon who was terrified
15:14
of sex and women and therefore hated both. He was so violently upset by even the thought
15:19
of interacting with a woman that he would experience what he called nervous sexual attacks. I do want to be sensitive to the fact that some people have experienced trauma,
15:29
which leads them to fear sex, or some people are simply aromantic or asexual, and i think
15:35
thats dope. But ts eliots outlook feels uncomfortably similar to a modern day mra
15:41
or even a violent incel. Seriously, weve read tons and tons of his poetry and a bunch of books about him to research
15:47
this video, and literally every detail we learn about him reveals yet another layer of his weird misogyny. For example, eliots poem the love song of saint sebastian,
15:57
contains these lovely lines: i would come in a hair shirt/i would come with a lamp in the night/and sit at the foot of your stair; /i would flog myself until i bled... /i would
16:06
come with a towel in my hand/and bend your head beneath my knees... /you would love me because i should have strangled you/and because of my infamy; /and i should love you the more
16:16
because i mangled you/and because you were no longer beautiful/to anyone but me. Now,
16:21
im just as into kink as the next girl, but this is not kink. Hes romanticizing an abusive relationship. Its also like, was all you had to do to be a successful writer
16:31
in the 1920s, was just release your private livejournal poetry? Eliot also strictly adhered to rules about what physical actions men or women were allowed
16:38
to enjoy. To eliot, men were supposed to penetrate. And women were supposed to be penetrated.
16:44
and not just penetrated by weeners, but even if that penetration is done by a weapon. Eliot
16:50
wrote those lines from the love song of saint sebastian after viewing these three paintings in various galleries in europe. The paintings depict saint sebastion being martyred. As
16:59
biographer lyndall gordon explains in her book eliots early years, the three paintings show innocent, firm-fleshed youths exposed to penetrant arrows. In a letter to conrad
17:09
aiken, eliot noted the eroticism and emphasized that, for him, a female saint would have been
17:15
more appropriate. This is literally a painting of someone being murdered, but eliot looks
17:20
at these arrows and thinks: hey, its my weener. So that should be a woman. What? Eliot was so obsessed with sex and the gender binary, he had to project his obsessions onto
17:29
what is supposed to be a religious spiritual image. Ew! And eliot is a seminal figure in western writing. I cannot stress enough how much influence
17:40
this guy, with his bananas ideas, have had on how we as english-speaking people view
17:46
art, or who has the right to create art, or what that art should say or portray. The values
17:52
that the western canon reflects lead directly back to eliots sick fetishes and fucked up livejournal posts.
17:58
by the way, ts eliot i know you think only women can be penetrated but.. Youre really
18:04
missing out. So, yeah, eliot wouldve recoiled at the sight of horny cats joyfully dancing to his
18:11
poetry, and i love the fact that a movie based on eliots poetry conflicts so dramatically with his source material. By the time we get to the current iteration of cats, eliots
18:21
original meaning is a bit muddled. From the baffling off the cuff cut-aways-- look
18:28
what the cat dragged in. [cricket chirps] -- to the static hopper shots that stop the
18:34
action in place, to the wildly different acting style choices--all these aspects obscure t. S.
18:40
eliots work to the point of parody. We now have rowdy screenings where we meow at the screen, and lap up milk and throw glitter into the air when t. Swift shakes her catnip
18:49
bottle. So its kind of perfect, because on a literal, pragmatic level, facism is absurd.
19:00
it makes no sense. Its inherently self-contradictory, by design. It demands that you deceive yourself
19:06
about the world around you. And then it demands that you live in denial.
19:16
oh shit! Eliot also loved stillness. Eliots poetry is very static, very still, lacking in movement.
19:29
the imagery in his poems often tends toward death, decay, and rot. In the poetics of fascism,
19:35
a deep dive into the fascist ideologies in the work of ts eliot and ezra pound, paul
19:40
morrison writes: eliot privileges stillness. But this stillness isnt just a lack of physical motion. It has larger cultural implications. Morrison continues: he is thus opposed
19:51
to any poetic that maintains or exacerbates the tension between the socially actual and desirable, between what is and what might be. Eliot doesnt just want the human
20:01
body to remain still. He wants all of culture, all of society to remain still, and his poetic
20:07
grammar reflects that. He is a poet who refuses to imagine a different or better world, which
20:12
kind of seems like it defeats the purpose of writing poetry, but okay, meow.
20:18
although eliot eventually moved to england and renounced his american passport, he was
20:23
born an american. The history of america is a history of cis, straight, white, land-owning
20:29
men policing bodies, most explicitly in the genocide carried out by european colonizers
20:35
against the people already living in america; and the slave trade, where black bodies were stripped of autonomy and even personal identity, then ordered to perform specific types of
20:45
labor, as if their bodies were viewed as one part in a larger machine. So the baseline
20:50
reality in american history has always been: people in power have the right to manipulate your body, more than you have a right to manipulate your own. And this power dynamic continues
21:00
today, in how black and other marginalized bodies are policed by... The police. Or how
21:06
reproductive rights are policed by men. Or how terves try to exclude trans bodies from
21:11
public spaces. Terves have taken the policing of body language to such a literal degree,
21:17
they want your genitals to be the sole determining factor in your entire future. From the tiniest
21:22
flick of the wrist being used to condemn someone as gay, to the wrong kind of look being used as proof that someone is a psychopatic pervert, or the way that my own voice and
21:32
face are labelled as trans by creeps in the comments section even though im cis--we are constantly told that we cant simply exist in physical space. We must exist
21:43
in the appropriate way. In the middle ages in europe, these kinds of rules about how to present yourself in
21:48
public were codified in the sumptuary laws, which governed what kinds of clothes different
21:53
genders or social classes were allowed to wear. It was a way to order society at the whims of the monarch. But since we westerners really excel at internalizing behavior that
22:04
causes self-harm, weve learned to enforce these customs on ourselves. Self-policing language is baked into our everyday interactions.
22:12
the theorist thomas yingling gave this description of how we reinforce societys values specifically
22:18
through our body language: one is taught young, for instance, that homosexuality is
22:26
semiotic, that there are signs of it, and that one ought not to produce those signs.
22:32
even as children, perhaps especially as children, gays are taught to hide their own signs and
22:37
substitute those of the dominant culture: boys who are sissies internalize quite early
22:42
that the signs of their sissihood are, absurdly, for they seem self-produced and contiguous
22:47
with identity, their enemy. They may in fact recognize that those who object to these signs
22:53
are also enemies, but the outcome is more often than not the repression of the signs
22:58
of sissihood (assuming here that children have not yet the code words gay or homosexual).
23:05
one false, and therefore true, sign is enough to bring on danger in certain situations,
23:11
literal exposure to persecution. So the problematic of the sign is forced upon the homosexual
23:16
at an early age--and in a manner that differs experientally from that detailed, for instance,
23:22
in afro-american texts, for there the sign of difference (blackness) is not considered
23:28
to be within ones control. So even though moving your own body in a certain way may
23:33
feel more natural to you, were taught to fear this bodily self-expression in the mirror and in others. Through childish bullying, we alienate ourselves from our own bodies.
23:44
then alienate other people since we are conditioned to make value judgments based on how they move, how they look, how they dress, how they carry themselves. This idea really gets to
23:53
the heart of why some people were upset at the straight-washing of the magical mr mistopholese character. In the live musical version, mr mistophoelse was this beautiful, unbridled
24:03
expression of body language. And in the new version, hes explicitly straight, and just
24:08
so happens to not have any of that same expressive body movements.
24:13
hollywood limits bodily expression by typecasting actors who look a particular way. Deformity
24:19
and disability are associated with mental illness, impotence, or evil. Heroism and virtue
24:25
are associated with good looks. In film, comedy and horror are the two main genres that allow extreme bodily expression.
24:33
comedy allows the body to be penetrable, to be gross, to be deformed or smushed into odd
24:39
positions. But in comedy the body also usually bounces back. Physical manipulation is temporary,
24:44
which gives us a sense of relief in the end. We are reassured that the body will heal.
24:50
in horror, however, the body is penetrable, gross, deformed, and smushed, but these unsettling
24:56
body movements are used to terrify us. In horror, the body does not bounce back. Mutilation
25:01
is permanent and it explores our fear of mortality. One example i want to point out is in the
25:07
silence of the lambs. Buffalo bill is demonized because the character both transgresses traditional gender roles
25:14
(by skinning a woman alive to wear her skin, and yearning for a female identity) and traditional
25:19
well-behaved society (by being a weirdo recluse. ) in contrast, hannibal gains the trust of those same people because while having committed
25:29
almost the exact same crimes as buffalo bill, but he doesnt transgress his traditional
25:34
gender roles (he skins a man alive, thank you very much, and does it in a very manly way) and traditional well-behaved society (hannibal has the mannerisms and co-ops the
25:44
signs of being a gentleman. ) lecter uses civilized body language as a means of making us not only identify with him, but even empathize with him and root for him.
25:54
on a literal level, their physical crimes are remarkably similar. But on a symbolic level, their social crimes are polar opposites.
26:01
yes, the crowd will cheer for a serial killer, or a war criminal, or a tyrant, as long as
26:07
that monster speaks with a particular cadence, dresses in a particular way, and regurgitates
26:12
particular euphemisms to excuse their own violent, abusive behavior. While certain genres benefit from stillness, or use it for particular effect, one genre
26:22
that is usually full of movement and expression is: musicals. Which is another weird thing
26:27
about cats 2019! Tom hooper loves shooting static closeups during the more dramatic songs
26:34
for some ungodly reason. These are my least favorite shots in the whole movie, and they bring the energy to a dead halt. In these shots, you can feel the actors struggling
26:42
against the stilted, unnatural framing, and its a bummer to see hoopers shot selection
26:48
sabotage these actors performances.
27:03
cats are famously unmoved by others, each cat is its own king of its own
27:09
land, socialist, wed be called by others, a bad word, ive heard, when uttered by men
27:16
even if you havent seen cats, youve probably heard that its basically two hours of cat characters introducing themselves, then singing songs about their own ridiculous
27:26
names and what they do in their spare time. The silly name motif is one of the many things about cats that feels random and pointless at first, but when we dig deeper we see that
27:36
it fits right into eliots stratified view of the universe. Eliot didnt view names as private property. To him, your name is inherent to your identity, handed down to
27:46
you from your parents, whose parents handed it down to them, and so on and so on. In the
27:51
poetics of fascism, morrison writes: names mean, or are one of the means whereby, the
27:56
subject is initially placed, put in its place, in relation to the social, which our culture
28:02
tends to manage through the reproduction of family names. From birth we are labelled by our parents, and these labels are spoken so casually, so matter-of-factly, that they
28:12
end up being baked into our identity, especially for a first born son who is given their fathers
28:18
full name. Like the way that kings will assume names like william the second, or henry
28:23
the eighth when they take the crown. They are folding their identities backwards in history, laying claim to the identities of their forefathers, or even to people they
28:32
have no relation to. By extension, these kings and queens lay claim to all those previous
28:37
peoples lands, properties, and divine rights. Its just one of the many ways that people in power use language to perpetuate their power, or as morrison puts it: to reproduce
28:48
the world as it has been conventionally produced. Which makes it even more infuriating that rey is a palpatine. In this essay i will expose--
28:57
this reproduction of the status quo is woven into the very fabric of the ts eliot poems
29:02
that cats is based on. Morrison writes: humankind is enjoined to recognize, not invent, spiritual
29:09
realities, and so the naming of cats is finally about the recognition, not the
29:14
giving, of names. Fascists obsess over names, especially jewish names, like the way that theyll use triple parentheses around a jewish name online to
29:23
signal the twisted idea that jewish names echo throughout history for their supposed crimes. So to someone like eliot, your name reveals a deeper truth about your identity, about
29:33
your family lineage, and about your place in society. We see this with skimbleshanks
29:38
the railway cat, whose identity is bound to his job. He doesnt just work for the rail
29:44
line, he is of the railway train, and everything we learn about him is simply the
29:50
details of his job. I can imagine eliot sitting on a train, watching the ticket agent collecting
29:55
tickets, and eliot is just totally unable to imagine that that ticket agent has any life beyond the walls of the traincar. To eliot, that working class person is nothing
30:05
more than a function of the train that eliot is paying to ride. Simply part of the larger machine.
30:11
one name that eliot uses to perpetuate the past is old deuteronomy. Eliot pulled the
30:17
name deuteronomy from the old testament. Deuteronomy is set right before the iseralites enter the
30:22
promised land. The laws that were first codified in the book of exodus leviticus and numbers
30:28
are reiterated and expanded upon in the book of deuteronomy. The name deuteronomy even
30:33
points to the idea that the book is a copy, a repetition, or a reproduction of those same
30:39
laws. So the character deuteronomy represents the law physically manifested in the body
30:45
of the king. But more importantly, try to image the book of deuteronomy from eliots point of view. From his point of view, or someone like mike pence, or any other militant
30:55
theocrat who sees the church as superior to the state, deuteronomy describes an ethno-state
31:00
where religion and law are one. Its their fantasy, man. There is no freedom without the law!
31:07
to defy ones leader who embodies the law, is to defy the lord god himself. Rhetorically
31:12
that leader becomes god, and we see this idea reflected in fasist propaganda. Like in the
31:19
1930s when a nazi pastor used this slogan during a confirmation service. He who serves
31:24
hitler serves germany. He who serves german serves god. Dont question me, or youre
31:31
questioning god, okay. In cats, all the characters, without exception, seem to view their society as a given, as
31:37
simply the way it is. They are seemingly unaware that their society is constructed,
31:42
and that its absolute wacky-town. None of the cats ask who am i? What does this all
31:49
mean? Or why does this deuteronomy guy get to pick who goes to the heaviside layer? The
31:54
entire play is them saying this is who i am this is who i am this is who i am, and, this
31:59
is what i do this is what i do this is what i do. Even the villain macavity isnt trying to disrupt the hierarchy. Hes simply trying to become the one who benefits from the hierarchy.
32:08
hes the joe biden of the cats universe. As a royalist and traditionalist, eliot believed that there was an ideal structure of society
32:17
an order dictated by god himself. One that involved a divinely-inspired king at the top,
32:23
with the unwashed masses at the bottom","If you want to directly support me and see this video without ads, check it out at https://nebula.tv/videos/maggie-mae-f...

the audience is important to any
0:01
celebrity's rise in function without an
0:04
enraptured and supportive audience
0:05
celebrities would be just like the rest
0:07
of us writer P David Marshall argued
0:10
that quote celebrity is an
0:12
acknowledgment of the public's power
0:13
take internet meme star and rapper
0:15
Danielle rego Lee also known as bad baby
0:19
aka cashed me outside there are
0:22
thousands of ill-tempered and culturally
0:24
appropriating white teenagers online but
0:27
Danielle's stardom was secured by the
0:28
public via social media who shared her
0:31
infamous appearance on dr. Phil millions
0:33
of times and engaged in the antics that
0:36
followed somewhere a girl exactly like
0:39
Danielle Drago lease it's non famous and
0:41
without lucrative endorsement deals
0:42
because she never was seen by the right
0:44
audience
0:45
but hold on I'm getting ahead of myself
0:47
if you have one do me a favor and think
0:50
about your favorite celebrity whether
0:52
they're an actress singer youtuber model
0:54
designer or author how much do you love
0:57
them does the extent of your love cover
0:59
lustful fantasies merchandise purchases
1:01
and social media interactions or does it
1:04
mean defending them against endless
1:06
criticism adopting their style or even
1:08
ignoring their worst behavior would you
1:10
cheat on your current partner with your
1:12
celebrity crush even if you knew your
1:14
partner wouldn't be okay with it
1:16
would you commit a violent crime for
1:17
your fave would you help your favorite
1:20
cover up the violent crimes
1:21
when does celebrity adoration cross over
1:24
into what has come to be known as
1:25
celebrity worship syndrome if you're one
1:28
of those people who doesn't have a
1:30
celebrity fave and you pride yourself on
1:32
not engaging in gossip before you
1:34
congratulate yourself for being so
1:35
evolved first you should understand that
1:37
the reasons most of society engages in
1:40
celebrity worship and gossip are layered
1:42
and varied historian Susan J Douglas and
1:45
Andrea McDonald point out in their books
1:47
celebrity a history of Fame but studies
1:50
show that gossip
1:51
despite its trivial reputation and
1:53
negative connotations actually serves
1:55
important functions such as encouraging
1:58
bonding and camaraderie among friends
2:00
and family members it can also allow us
2:02
to release stress share ideas and
2:05
strengthen friendships via gossip
2:07
Society sketches standards
2:09
shared morality and revises or outright
2:12
denies what is and what is an acceptable
2:14
behavior as the authors noted when we
2:17
judge celebrities and find fault in
2:19
their actions we have the opportunity to
2:21
affirm our own moral codes or punish
2:24
deviance thus creating and reinforcing
2:26
boundaries around our own moral
2:28
frameworks celebrities also serve as a
2:31
stand-in for current and long-running
2:33
socio political discourse intentions for
2:36
example when many black people rushed to
2:38
defend OJ Simpson in 1994 a lot of the
2:41
support came from long simmering disgust
2:43
with the justice system and accusations
2:46
of rape and violence by black men or
2:48
recall that New York after few be
2:51
discussed in a short history of American
2:52
celebrity supporters of one actor
2:55
rallied around his American heritage and
2:57
lower class status allowing them to
3:00
project their nativist beliefs and class
3:02
solidarity while the British actor
3:04
resonated with the elites and British
3:06
people supporting what actor can be seen
3:09
as taking a political stance speaking of
3:11
politics
3:12
another thing feeding our obsession with
3:14
celebrities is that unlike politics and
3:16
current affairs which can be alienating
3:19
or let's face it boring gossip about
3:21
celebrities allows people to judge and
3:24
offer opinions without much thinking you
3:26
don't have to be right when it comes to
3:28
celebrity commentary there is no complex
3:31
formula method or studying involved just
3:33
a quick eyeball of the current gossip in
3:35
an edition of your own two cents based
3:38
on your own beliefs lifestyle and
3:39
experiences as for the people we choose
3:41
to spend so much time talking about one
3:44
study pointed out evolutionary
3:46
biologists say it's natural for humans
3:48
to look up to individuals who receive
3:50
attention because they have succeeded in
3:52
society in prehistoric times this would
3:55
have meant respecting good hunters and
3:56
elders but as hunting is now not an
3:58
essential skill and longevity is more
4:00
widely achievable these qualities are no
4:03
longer revered instead we look to
4:05
celebrities whose fame and fortune we
4:07
want to emulate
4:08
evolutionary biologist countered that
4:10
it's more about entertainment stating
4:12
we're fascinated even when we don't go
4:15
out of our way to copy them so already
4:17
we have two different reasons for the
4:18
growing power of celebrities a desire to
4:21
be entertained by them and a desire to
4:23
emulate them so let's talk about the
4:25
three-tiered celebrity worship scale
4:27
created by psychoanalysts in 2002 there
4:30
are low worship people who watch and
4:32
read about celebrities and are motivated
4:34
by sensation seeking and entertainment
4:36
intermediate celebra shippers more
4:38
broadly integrate their favorite
4:40
celebrities personalities into their own
4:41
lives using them as social cues
4:44
meanwhile high celebrity worship was
4:46
described as excessive empathy with the
4:48
celebrities successes and failures over
4:50
identifying with the celebrity and
4:52
obsessively following the details of a
4:54
celebrity's life this sounds like a lot
4:57
of people which is probably why the
4:59
celebrity worship scale evolved into the
5:01
celebrity attitude scale and the
5:03
categories have more detailed metrics
5:05
low worship became entertainment social
5:08
denoting that people in this category
5:10
see celebrities as commodifying and
5:13
consumable products for their own
5:14
entertainment intermediate became
5:17
intense personal describing the people
5:19
who take social cues from celebrities
5:21
and use them as a source of self esteem
5:23
or personality these are the people who
5:25
wear outfits like their faves adopt
5:27
their slang purchase products they
5:29
endorse etc hi celebrity worship became
5:32
borderline pathological and involves
5:34
people with violent or unrealistic
5:36
fantasies involving celebrities that
5:39
could lead to dangerous behavior like
5:40
stalking or as a metric in the study
5:42
stated for respondents to agree with
5:44
their dispute if I were lucky enough to
5:46
meet my favorite celebrity and he or she
5:48
asked me to do something illegal as a
5:49
favor I would probably do it borderline
5:52
pathological behavior could include
5:54
people who get plastic surgery to look
5:56
exactly like their favorite celebrity on
5:58
the soft end or someone like Yolanda
6:00
Saldivar
6:01
you probably remember her as the
6:03
murderer of Selena big years Selena she
6:06
won a Grammy when I was a girl I was
6:09
like a dream come true or done
6:10
but Yolanda was a fan who begged
6:13
Selena's father to allow her to start a
6:15
fan club and she embezzled money when
6:17
she was discovered and fired she felt so
6:19
betrayed by her favorite celebrities
6:21
dismissal that she shot her another
6:24
example of a dangerous stan is John
6:26
Hinckley jr. who became so obsessed with
6:28
Jodie Foster after seeing her in taxi
6:30
driver that he attempted to assassinate
6:32
Reagan to impress her Hinckley had what
6:35
is now referred to as erotomania in
6:38
which a deluded person falsely believes
6:40
a person is in love with them this is
6:42
the reason for many celebrity stands who
6:44
turn the stalking sociologist Josh
6:47
game-san came up with another way to
6:48
categorize those who engage in celebrity
6:50
culture and this scale even includes
6:53
some people who may claim to hate it
6:54
let's say there are three friends
6:56
traditional Tina believes all positive
6:59
gossip about her favorite celebrities
7:00
and everything negative about
7:02
celebrities she despises she's unaware
7:04
of the industry of celebrity production
7:06
publicity social media management
7:08
investors etc instead believing that
7:11
Fame is an organic recognition of
7:13
internal gifts and that thanks people
7:15
are worthy of special treatment because
7:16
of it she's the friend who gobbles up
7:19
charitable publicity stunts and photo
7:20
opportunities and consumes pop-culture
7:23
uncritically next up is second order
7:25
traditionalist Tasha
7:27
who has an ignorant of celebrity
7:29
production she knows about the team of
7:31
writers stylists publicists and
7:33
marketing execs that makes Beyonce
7:35
Beyonce but she still appreciates
7:37
Beyonce's talent and supports her she
7:39
finds inspiration and escapism and
7:41
Beyonce but she also acknowledges that
7:44
she is a lucrative consumer of Beyonce
7:46
the brand this nuanced perspective means
7:48
that she would be more willing to
7:50
question celebrities and politics than
7:52
someone like traditional Tina
7:54
then there's anti believer Akira who
7:57
game send labels a postmodernist a Karen
8:00
knows about the production of
8:01
celebrities so she enjoys to seek out
8:03
evidence of celebrity production to
8:06
dismiss all ascension to fame or any
8:08
type of gossip about celebrities as fake
8:10
and contrived when meg the stallion
8:12
broke up with money bag yo or post
8:14
photos of her with various high-profile
8:16
men sparking internet discourse think
8:18
pieces and music streams
8:20
like traditional Tina calls mega hoe or
8:22
defends her against accusations of being
8:25
a hoe because she perceives the press
8:27
around Meg to be 100 percent authentic
8:29
she takes her celebrity debate seriously
8:32
and gets emotionally invested in them
8:34
meanwhile a Carol would declare Meg's
8:36
sole intention to be publicity in the
8:39
middle is Tasha who believes that
8:41
whether or not meg is trying to engage
8:43
her audience with good gossip there's no
8:45
harm in chatting about it for
8:46
entertainment value this spectrum shows
8:49
that not everyone engages in celebrity
8:51
culture passively back in the 40s
8:54
critics were skeptical that radio movies
8:56
and magazines would damage fans
8:58
abilities to see the world critically
9:00
and categorize all fans as passive
9:03
consumers an idea that didn't change
9:04
until the 1980s with the introduction of
9:07
Gamson spectrum in a short history of
9:09
celebrity I mentioned that movie screens
9:12
radios and TVs created a sense of
9:14
familiarity between the public and Starz
9:16
innovations in media tech have provided
9:19
us with more illusions of intimacy with
9:21
celebrities especially for the younger
9:23
generation because they're always on
9:25
their phones for instance you could tune
9:27
into your favorite rapper a singer on
9:28
Instagram live and even have a chance to
9:31
see them reply to you in real time on
9:32
Twitter for fans who belong in the
9:34
intense personal category or who are
9:36
traditionalists it's easy to see why
9:38
stam culture grows exponentially for a
9:41
growing number of teens and young adults
9:42
reared on in-your-face celebrity culture
9:45
being a stan is normalized studies have
9:48
linked obsessive celebrity worship to
9:50
poor body image and adolescents an
9:52
increased chance of obtaining plastic
9:54
surgery and a personality style
9:56
characterized by sensation-seeking
9:58
cognitive rigidity identity diffusion
10:00
and poor interpersonal boundaries
10:02
basically stands are more likely to be
10:05
attention obsessed close-minded unsure
10:07
about their own identity and socially
10:10
awkward and/or nosy studies have also
10:12
linked high levels of celebrity worship
10:15
to poor mental health depression anxiety
10:17
and social dysfunction when you think
10:19
about it this is the antithesis of the
10:21
lifestyle sold by many celebrities and
10:23
their marketing and branding you know
10:25
the good vibes only confident carefree
10:27
life is good money brings me happiness
10:29
mentality
10:30
up until now I'm alluded to the
10:32
production of celebrities quite a bit a
10:34
major thing exacerbating stand culture
10:36
is the actual industry behind
10:38
celebrities you know capitalism has
10:40
something to do with this right
10:41
celebrity production is an industry that
10:43
relies on various workers from
10:46
hairstylist to lawyers to catering
10:48
companies to choreographers to
10:50
songwriters to executive producers
10:52
billions if not trillions of dollars are
10:55
generated through the commodification of
10:57
celebrity in various fields in this
10:59
theory celebrities are commodities that
11:01
serve as sources of capital that can be
11:03
discarded when they lose their value in
11:05
order to make room for someone else
11:06
producing and maintaining celebrities
11:09
through various money avenues product
11:11
endorsement movies albums etc is
11:13
lucrative for everybody involved because
11:16
celebrities are so profitable for
11:18
various people in corporations little
11:20
regard is paid to the ethics of
11:22
celebrity production this brings us back
11:24
to the underaged Danielle Brooke Olli
11:26
whose handlers push stories about her
11:28
being involved with adult men or her
11:30
outlandish behavior more than they do
11:31
her music or you can think about highly
11:34
violent celebrities who prosper because
11:36
of how lucrative they are or how Helen
11:38
people covered up for Harvey Weinstein
11:40
because his role in the celebrity
11:42
production machine put money in their
11:44
own pockets here you can also turn your
11:47
attention to the numerous child and teen
11:49
stars who are fed through the Hollywood
11:51
machine who are financially sexually
11:53
physically or mentally abused without
11:55
anybody doing anything about it the
11:57
thickest part is that even when they're
11:59
jumped on the side of the road is has
12:00
bends with drug problems or mental
12:02
health issues they're still a profitable
12:05
part of the industry gossip sites
12:06
tabloid magazines and TV shows alone are
12:09
a three billion dollar industry
12:11
controversy drives gossip and attracts
12:14
audiences both negative and positive the
12:17
fame industry then capitalizes on that
12:19
audience despite any harmful effects of
12:21
doing so because celebrities are so
12:23
profitable the goal for the industry is
12:25
to build an audience and this usually
12:27
doesn't happen organically the desire
12:29
for profit doesn't leave room for
12:30
blackballing racists rapist or woman
12:33
beaters instead there are photoshoots
12:35
marketing campaigns press opportunities
12:37
publication features public philanthropy
12:39
and
12:40
things again involving a litter of
12:42
people paid to help produce and promote
12:44
content that make such people more
12:46
appealing these things not only build
12:48
the celebrity and repair their
12:50
reputations even when they don't deserve
12:51
it but create illusions of intimacy for
12:54
the fans fan itself is derived from the
12:56
Latin word fanatic as' which means
12:58
insanely but divinely inspired as we
13:01
discussed earlier the celebrity is
13:03
nothing without their audience so the
13:05
same industry uses every available
13:07
opportunity to create insanely loyal
13:10
fans who in turn keep the celebrity
13:12
profitable a lot of people you stand
13:14
colloquially to mean adoration or
13:17
support not the crazy obsessive
13:19
potentially lethal stand coined by
13:21
Eminem in 2000 but celebrity worship
13:24
disorder is real celebrity worship is
13:26
the result of faux intimacy and
13:28
celebrity commodification gone too far
13:30
in addition to people like the crazed
13:32
man who broke into Rihanna's home on
13:34
numerous occasions we know this because
13:36
people send death threats and hate
13:38
speech to others over a difference in
13:40
opinion about their favorite celebrities
13:41
people find joy in dragging the
13:45
unfortunate souls who dare critique
13:47
their face stand them is most evident in
13:50
certain professions psychologist Mark D
13:52
Griffiths noted any person who was in
13:54
the public eye can be the object of a
13:56
person's obsession authors politicians
13:59
journalists but research and criminal
14:01
prosecution suggests they're more likely
14:03
to be someone from the world of
14:05
television film and or pop music Stan
14:08
Culture remarkably can also be theorized
14:11
as a reaction to the fall of religious
14:13
influence as the power of religious
14:15
institutions is waned over the past half
14:17
century people still look for something
14:19
bigger than themselves to admire or
14:20
aspire to writer Chris rashik said as
14:23
with God's we can project intensely
14:25
positive even worshipful feelings or
14:27
into celebrities and this connection can
14:30
compensate for feelings of invalidation
14:32
and incompleteness somewhere in their
14:34
lives now some stands are anarchists or
14:37
sadists who enjoy cruel problematic
14:38
behavior think followers of 50 centre
14:40
Tommy Lehren but what about good people
14:43
who support celebs with toxic traits
14:45
religious kind of relationship with
14:47
celebrities would explain why Stan's
14:48
find it so hard to acknowledge when
14:50
there
14:51
means do something wrong creative
14:52
talents aside France tense I know people
14:55
who abhor male rape apologists but give
14:58
free passes to Nicki Minaj who has
15:00
supported her rapist brother worked with
15:02
a rapist and married a rapist check the
15:04
court documents before you come for me
15:05
in the comments because of clothes
15:07
feelings of intimacy they have for her
15:09
they let this go she's a talented woman
15:11
who's worked hard to get to her spot
15:13
they felt all of her losses and they
15:15
feel like proud parents whenever she
15:17
wins they are emotionally attached
15:19
because they feel like they know her and
15:21
can be happy through her a friend
15:23
mentioned how Niki has gotten her
15:25
through hard times and inspired her at
15:27
her lowest points something won before
15:29
the 20th century would usually say about
15:31
God then there are others who continue
15:34
to stand Nicky because of shared
15:35
identities whether organic or imagined
15:37
think of the island girls who love her
15:39
heritage those who have suffered with
15:41
substance abuse are those who have been
15:43
emulating her persona for so long that
15:45
to deviate from it would be painful and
15:48
would leave them confused about who they
15:49
really are
15:50
this isn't exclusive to Nicki Minaj the
15:53
racist jeffree star maintains a loyal
15:55
mostly white and queer fan base that
15:57
excuses his behavior because he serves
15:59
as their representations
16:01
if someone bases their entire
16:03
personality off of someone with toxic
16:05
patterns of trash behavior and attitudes
16:07
wouldn't acknowledging that person's
16:09
flaws require a hard look at one's own
16:11
identity and aren't people pretty bad at
16:13
self reflecting as it is John Fisk
16:16
introduced the concept of semiotic
16:18

the box office as a win for the

On Writing: Mental Illness in Video Games | a video essay,"246,532","21,000",4/3/20,33:33,"0:00
this video is going to deal with sensitive and potentially dangerous issues for some people I want to preface this essay by saying that I'm a trained
0:06
youth counselor at a youth mental health and suicide prevention helpline and I've been helping people struggling with
0:11
suicidality self-harm depression and other issues for years now if these things would be dangerous for you to
0:17
engage with I would ask you not to watch this video I've linked a video of some adorable fluffy kittens up in the corner
0:23
of the screen as always resources are linked down below and I encourage you to take care of yourself first otherwise
0:30
let's begin this video is made in consultation with take this org a charity dedicated to a
0:38
mental health in the gaming community
Background
0:45
plan means time frame these are the three primary indicators when assessing
0:51
risk of suicide in 2017 Bethesda released play a retro-futuristic action
0:57
mystery game telling the story of Morgan you who wakes up and not knowing who they are on a spaceship and fisted with
1:03
the alien - Morgan is a flawed character who has to face up to their past mistakes and change throughout the game
1:10
two years later in tween 19 this game saves a girl's life thus girl who will
1:17
call Ashley had been diagnosed with a borderline personality disorder when through a hard breakup and found herself
1:23
in a vortex of depression and anxiety that culminated in a planned into her life Ashley even still a date even when
1:30
that means she was a high-risk case but then she found the game prey and regardless of the intentions of the
1:37
developers the game modeled therapy of a kind for her as she drove the decisions in Morgan's story the narrative helping
1:43
her come to term with her mistakes accept herself and move forward in time that's it date passed her plan was no
1:51
longer needed video games differ from books TV shows
1:59
and films through one major force agency the interactive nature of the medium
2:04
allows us to engage with the text to ideas on a different level players don't just passively experience the story
2:11
characters and themes but actively participate in their creation progression and conclusion and while
2:17
it's good the player agency means that games have a lot of potential to help those who are struggling there is also a
2:22
lot of risk and introducing agency to exploring mental health and that makes things complicated the YouTube algorithm
2:30
doesn't not like videos like this and sponsors just do not feel appropriate for it at all this is why only my
2:37
patrons independent support makes it possible for me to research take time for consult on and create videos like
2:43
this any support at the link below immensely appreciated part one just
Part 1 Just Breathe
2:54
breathe you can do this in a 2015 Poland University study Sheena ramela
3:00
highlighted two unique opportunities that video games represent for mental health therapeutic game playing which
3:05
provides players with therapy if they are struggling themselves and informative game playing through which
3:10
players can vicariously learn and understand the trials that people with mental illness go through in 2018
3:17
extremely ok games released Celeste a 2d platformer about a girl called Medellin
3:22
struggling with anxiety and depression humbly described on its reddit as a video game about climbing a mountain
3:28
about halfway through the story she has a panic attack and the player has to try and control her breathing by helping a
3:34
feather float calmly up and down in time with her slowing breath as the player
3:40
brings her breathing under control the visuals of the game come but if the player stops focusing then it becomes
3:47
erratic again Sheena Miller describes therapeutic game playing in four steps first the designer researchers treatment
3:54
methods second the designer incorporates them into the game thirdly the plan navigates the game world and fourthly
4:00
consciously or unconsciously they receive treatment writer mad for sense certainly researched or had used a very
4:07
real anxiety attack coping strategy and incorporated it and DISA lists a player
4:13
navigating it's beautiful 2d world would learn this strategy and though the game
4:18
was not intended as therapy they do receive a kind of therapy but
4:24
understanding the role of agency here is more crucial numerous studies have shown
4:29
that active learning being a hands-on and personally involved with a decree of agency and B having the ability to
4:37
succeed and fail is a far more efficient way of learning than passive learning listening watching or reading the agency
4:45
given to players navigating the game world and mechanics is a form of active learning fundamentally games are about
4:52
teaching people to get better at mechanics hence why the difficulty tends to escalate in a game and this is all
4:58
reinforced by 2016 study on games as learning methods that found that students in the game-playing
5:03
intervention group were more likely to show a positive score change than the control group students with improved
5:09
communication scores adaptability and resourcefulness now there they were teaching children graduate skills but
5:15
it's clear from this quality that video games are a potentially more effective avenue of therapy than other fiction
5:22
forms teaching people coping strategies and helping them deal with their mental health struggles in celeste the player
5:28
is involved with active therapeutic game learning in the panic attack scene learning the feather mechanic while also
5:35
learning the coping mechanism themselves and part of this comes down to a difference in perspective TV shows books
5:41
and films typically make the reader or viewer an outsider to the person with the mental health struggles we are
5:48
observing the story of someone else whereas games are much closer to a first-person experience where agency
5:56
makes the characters actions your actions especially because planned characters and games are often designed
6:01
to allow us to project ourselves onto them even sometimes to the point of personal character creation even in
6:08
first-person book narratives using AI it still feels like we are being told the
6:14
story but the agency here means that the panic of the Medellin fields is much
6:19
more your panic and the coping strategy much more your skill when you learn it
6:24
because of this it will stick with you more effectively than simply being told about it the agency element of games
6:31
also means that when mechanics like this are taught they taught at the pace that the player needs to learn them they're
6:37
allowed to try and to fail to exact their skill a vital part of
6:43
internalizing this mental health coping mechanism this is markedly different to
6:48
books and visual media which don't allow that they go at the pace the author or
6:53
the director dictated it should go and their feet in this here is well proven a 2016 study found games assisted with
7:01
general anxiety as a hands-on exercise it helped prevent people from for example skin picking or nail biting
7:08
likewise a 2007 study found the social element of world Warcraft helped with social anxiety the
7:15
simulated world allowed people to speak and act more freely when they otherwise would not feel comfortable but the role
7:23
of player agency in therapeutic game learning has a downside the recent twenty20 game the suicide of
7:29
Rachel Foster explores the story of well Rachel Foster and what eventually led to
7:35
her supposed suicide but what really matters here is that after a sickening realization the player is forced into a
7:42
position where the player character is considering killing herself the player is forced to actively go through the
7:49
steps of preparing for her ultimate suicide the details of which we will not go into here in other media forms though
7:56
you may understand a character's motivation to suicide there's a visual and psychological distance between you
8:03
and them but you are not watching someone else here as before player
8:10
agency means that these actions feel like your own these hands feel like
8:15
yours and that can be markedly dangerous for someone in a bad headspace not only teaching them a way to kill themselves
8:21
by putting a practiced plan into their head you often hear that you shouldn't report on how people into their lives
8:29
and part of why this is is they're the three greatest indicators of risk our plan means and time frame how they would
8:36
do it whether they have access to the things required to do it and when they would do it placing players in a
8:41
position where they actively engage with following through on a suicide is an incredibly risky thing for that subset
8:47
of people a 2015 study found video games that simulate death and violence to
8:52
oneself and others make them fear death less and less sensitive to pain increased acquired capability allows
8:59
individuals to overcome the fear and pain that would usually inhibit a suicide attempt games that simulate
9:05
self-harm and suicide not only heighten the chance of them finding a plan by giving them a concrete idea and letting
9:13
them see it play out from their perspective like a rehearsal but player agency here undoes those inhibitions in
9:20
a way that we haven't found other fiction forms do and to make it worse games like the sewers
9:26
Rachel Foster often use a soft fade as they die making it seem peaceful and
9:31
relieving which just isn't true it's a horrible way to go from this just as
9:37
player agency can be an effective framework for therapy and empathy it can
9:43
also become a dangerous motivator and enabler part 2 nobody cares about me
Part 2 Life is Strange
9:53
opening in downloads 2015 game life is
9:58
strange the player intervenes to save Kate Marsh from taking her own life if you've paid attention to her throughout
10:03
the game her life and how she thinks then you'll be able to stop her if you haven't know then she dies for much the
10:11
same reason as Celeste this was pretty personally cathartic for me as someone who has been in similar
10:18
situations to max here saving Kate wasn't just narrative lis satisfying but
10:23
personally validating especially when I've been unable to stop people close to me attempting in the past but this
10:31
raises the question what if you don't save her there is a myth about mental
10:37
health mental health is often treated as a single person centric problem that one
10:43
person is struggling and it's about them but this isn't true it's really hard to
10:50
be the support especially the only support for someone struggling with depression self-harm suicide or other
10:57
issues which is the position that the player finds themself in as max Caulfield to examine why agency becomes
11:05
a problem here though we have to understand something called the locus of control the degree to which someone
11:10
believes that their life is inside their control internal or outside their control external numerous studies have
11:18
shown that the ability to develop a locus that understands which things are outside your control and which things
11:24
are inside your control is key to handling stress and trauma now books in visual fiction like John
11:31
Green's Turtles all the way down reinforce that external locus of control we aren't responsible for the characters
11:38
what falls them or how they deal with it but in video games player agency means
11:43
that we not only feel responsible for characters like Kade taking their own life but we are the only variable in the
11:51
game that could have ever saved them there was no option where Kate stepped
11:56
back from the ledge herself nor one where another character intervened feelings of guilt responsibility if only
12:03
I said this or did that are really hard to deal with for the people surrounding
12:09
those suffering I would know and it's okay to acknowledge that but we have to
12:16
be careful about what we're saying is the players fault because allowing
12:21
player agency to reinforce those negative thoughts of guilt isn't the
12:27
healthiest but the question remains then how do we handle this I don't think that
12:33
life estrange has necessarily bad representation here I talked in my first video extensively about how fiction
12:39
impacts those who suffer and those who don't very differently and that those are two different problems though that
12:46
was my experience someone else may find that being the only person who could save Kate is a motivating force to help
12:53
others in real life because they feel more responsible now and that's a healthy thing but fundamentally this is
13:00
where it being a good informative game that helps non mentally ill people empathize comes into conflict with it
13:06
being a good therapeutic game and it's not necessarily something that we can
13:12
resolve other than to perhaps make it clearer who the game is made for we tend
13:18
to try and come up with single formulas or a totalizing theory about how to do mental illness right whatever that means
13:26
but I'm not sure that's possible instead when it comes to narratives that deal
13:32
with mental health we have to ask what does the role of player agency tell the player they are responsible for we might
13:39
not be responsible for Kate's death but we are responsible for whether we paid attention and reached out when we saw
13:46
her struggling part three let go of talion battle with
Part 3 Let Go
13:58
the exception of games like what remains of Edith Finch videogames they usually structured around players mastering game
14:04
mechanics and overcoming obstacles often with violence and this leads to the
14:09
unfortunate intersection of mental illness stigma and violent gameplay the number one damaging math about mental
14:15
illness is that they are inherently violent I don't have a problem with the combat which I see and its demands for
14:21
complex manual skills as a part of the gamers enjoyment but presenting in character why the lives in a constant
14:26
cycle a break where she perceives people as demons and lops off the hills with a giant sword is not helpful the fact
14:33
remains that they are suggesting that mentally ill people do not see reality and a tank violently not only a mentally
14:39
ill people ten times more likely to be the victims of violence than the perpetrators with only four percent of
14:44
violent acts attributed to those living with the mental illness but the nature of player engagement and agency often
14:49
means their mental illness is either tied to the justification for violence in a game think vast Montenegro from Far
14:55
Cry 3 whose main justification for becoming a violent obstacle for the player to overcome is madness or it's
15:03
used as a way to alter violent gameplay in video games think Alice the Menace Returns where
15:08
manifestations of mental illness are used to create unique enemies this runs into the good game problem similar to
15:16
the good story problem I talked about in that first video that sometimes good gameplay can be at odds with a good
15:22
informative game we're simply more likely to engage with games that portray mental illness in a certain way and not
15:29
necessarily good we may just enjoy games that use mental illness to spice up the
15:35
combat now while we should dismantle the idea of this group being violent the mere fact that there is stigma around it
15:42
doesn't mean that we shouldn't explore the connection between mental illness and violence which is a mistake I think
15:48
a lot of critics make in a vice documentary about the Filipino child sick straight they talked about how
15:53
emotional release therapy is one of releasing all the negative emotions of the children and this includes you
16:00
violence in a safe space and games allow for exactly that kind of thing
16:06
video game violence like inhale blades to know a sacrifice can be incredibly cathartic for people struggling meaning
16:12
violence can be a foundational part of a therapeutic game without reinforcing that negative stigma hell-blade uses
16:20
fantastical violence as a lens to explore sin who is frustrated place her anger with herself and her anger with
16:26
the world constantly seeming at war with her own mind and those trying to put her
16:31
down around her but as Traci Conkle puts it the story of Hell bleed is much more
16:37
one of a person whose problems have arisen from violence done to her and who is herself far from violent the
16:44
emotional experience of the story is one of deep empathy using the saddening violence as a lens to which we can
16:51
understand the pressures on her and what feels like a constant fight and everything she does the deeper question
16:57
is not merely whether it associates mental illness with violence but whether the game uses violence in a way that
17:03
inspires empathy for the character rather than demonization which is what you'll find in a hell of a lot of horror
17:09
games like amnesia the Dark Descent and outlast that sprinklin a little mental
17:14
illness to make the game play scarier and give us justification for violence without ever asking us to imbecile their
17:23
mental state more deeply and to avoid reinforcing that negative stigma some games employee an entirely different
17:29
model of player engagement and game mechanics when dealing with mental illness Marc Brown over at game makers
17:35
toolkit discussed games like Deus Ex and life is strange the game doesn't tell you which dialogue option will work you
17:42
have to decide for yourself by reading their mood their reaction to your previous dialogue choices and other
17:48
social cues all these games test your emotional and social skills just like how puzzle games test your
17:54
logic skills we can make dialog trees that aren't just basic skill chicks that let you skip through gameplay but are
18:01
involved negotiations that become involving gameplay in and of themselves downs here describes game mechanics that
18:07
rely less on violence reaction time strategy and build optimization and instead focus on social and emotional
18:14
skills like you have to use in fire watch and actual sunlight and this isn't just using game mechanics as an analog
18:21
for developing coping mechanisms and empathy for others like in Grist but actually using directly translatable
18:27
skills in game play life is strange acts as an informative game that teaches players to look for signs and others and
18:34
how they talk and how they act that might indicate suicidal ideation for example phrases like but she's been
18:41
extra quiet and introverted the past couple weeks she looks like she's in zombie mode that would be every fly to
18:47
me at the helpline but it wouldn't necessarily be to others but this model also helps with developing therapeutic
18:54
games for example allowing people with anxiety to play through difficult social interactions in a safe environment an
19:01
experience that is incredibly helpful and therapeutic violence can be a healthy part of either an informative
19:08
game or a therapeutic game for mental illness but inventing other models of player engagement and game mechanics can
19:15
also be really valuable and I think it's really important that we look for when these two different styles are more
19:22
appropriate part four one last thing a
Part 4 One Last Thing
19:28
shadow is following you in frictional
19:33
games 2010 and me Jie the Dark Descent players have to manage a sanity meter as
19:38
it goes down the player will experience hallucinations and delusions with changes to their vision hearing fake
19:45
screams and altering what they know to be real or not this is intended to reflect the very real dsm-5 symptoms of
19:52
schizophrenia and the game is heavily designed around your ability to master this game mechanic it's basically what lets you survive
19:59
learning and using strategies to keep your sanity high similar mechanics that the player can learn and control are
20:05
used in other games games are after all designed around players mastering predictable game mechanics and
20:11
overcoming obstacles players have to do something that's what makes them fun now
20:17
obviously amnesia is depiction of schizophrenia here is reductionist and incredibly inaccurate but I don't think
20:24
that that criticism alone gets to the heart of the issue here exclude mental illness from
20:29
representation in game mechanics simply because they in some way simplify them
20:34
nope for example ingress as the player character overcomes her depression and grief she gradually attains abilities
20:41
that allow her to move more freely a simplified idea of how rising out of depression is psychologically liberating
20:48
yes but not harmful representation it's more problem for games that use a resource management mechanic designed
20:55
around you managing your mental health issues for example keeping your anxiety self-harm urges hallucinations or
21:02
otherwise in chick see mental illness isn't something that can be gamed easily
21:07
predicted or controlled to a tee like a game mechanic unlike many visible illnesses pills and
21:13
self-care strategies that may work for one person won't work for the next and recovery is often a long inconsistent
21:20
road of relapses it is not a mechanic you can master so when it comes to
21:26
designing an informative game aimed at helping non mentally ill people empathize seeing mental illness doesn't
21:32
work like many visible illnesses isn't just one part of a mental illness that we can sort of simplify but fundamental
21:39
to understanding what it's like to live with it on a very base level the truth is we too often hear the stigmatizing
21:47
messages if all you need is some fresh air just take your pills they help
21:52
they're good but treating them like some kind of cure is just entirely
21:57
misinformed and really alienating so let's compare amnesia and Celeste we
22:03
talked before about that further meccanica that the player is taught to use and rely on as a method of explicitly managing your panic attacks
22:10
the game Falls you into thinking you can always overcome your anxiety by getting really good at using the feather
22:17
mechanic but later on in the game writer Matt Thorson goes the extra step here
22:22
with his manage your anxiety mechanic during a tense confrontation a panic attack hits you but when you try to use
22:29
the floating feather mechanic it doesn't work the feather breaks anxiety isn't
22:36
something that can be gamed here and we feel the same loss of control all the Medellin does subverting player
22:42
agency and really helping its role as an informative game 2013 game depression
22:48
quiz does a similar thing where the character is sometimes simply unable to do things because of their depression
22:54
fundamentally when it comes to games that have a mechanic requiring you to manage your mental health subvert in
23:00
player agency is necessary to an extent to make it an informed experience and this is markedly different to games like
23:07
life is strained we're acknowledging someone takes anti-anxiety medication is just part of narrative and you can
23:14
incorporate this idea relatively easily rather than as a game mechanic that the player will try to master and
23:19
unfortunately this does once again intersect with the good game problem that the best gaming experience does not
23:25
necessarily make for the best informative game despite being perhaps a more authentic experience the player
23:32
being unable to rely on certain game mechanics to work consistently can lead to a frustrating feeling of pointlessly
23:39
stunted game progression this is actually the point of depression quest to make you feel that frustration and it
23:47
works one way to deal with this in game design is to make it inevitable like the writers did for the ending of hell-blade
23:53
where players have to realize that continuing to fight like they did before will not beat this obstacle player
24:00
agency as subvert it as they have to choose to stop fighting something they were conditioned against the entire game
24:06
much like Sinnoh has to realize that she needs to stop fighting the feeling of loss and instead confronted a powerful
24:13
and difficult thematic realization for player and character or alternatively
24:18
like in celeste use the subversion of player agency to not just stall the
24:24
gameplay and set the player back but let that failure lead on to new and different obstacles creating very
24:30
gameplay that still accounts for this uncomfortable reality
Part 5 Realism
24:36
part five I still thought I could save him even after he said he was being
24:43
crowned king over all the lands of wonder in giant sparrows what remains of
24:50
Edith Finch you explore the story of Lois and it's one of the most horrifying and touching gaming experiences I have
24:57
ever had the player is put into Lewis's character working at a cannery the
25:02
mechanics involved moving a fish from one side of the screen to the other cutting off the head and pushing them
25:08
forward with just your mouse the player does this over and over and over again
25:14
for nearly ten minutes straight as you do so though an imaginative adventure
25:20
story begins to take over the screen like Lois your mind becomes focused on that imaginative more interesting world
25:27
while you absent-mindedly continue your job eventually though when it takes over
25:33
the entire screen it leads to the metaphorical suicide of Lois Finch what
25:38
I want to focus on here is realism critics of mental health representation often focus on a very particular kind of
25:45
realism focusing on things like the exact drugs a character takes the escalation of their harmful urges what
25:52
they are like in their day to day life and realistic patterns of relapse and rehabilitation and thus stories that
25:59
don't reflect those sorts of things get criticized but I don't think that we
26:04
should criticize purely based on thing unrealistic equals thing bad accuracy
26:10
does matter but I think that this critique is not only pointlessly reductionist but it misses the value
26:16
power and proper role of fiction in the first place videogames are a fictional
26:21
way to explore real things and that's their strength not a weakness I talked briefly before about how the
26:28
metaphorical mechanics and art style of Gris beautifully captures the feeling of depression and grief even if they're not
26:35
grounded in this specific kind of realism likewise what remains of Edith
26:40
Finch doesn't really do any of these stereotypically realistic things either
26:45
this is not what suicide depression or hallucinations usually look like at
26:51
all but perhaps more than any other game what remains of Edith Finch more empathetically captures what suicidal
26:58
ideation feels like it doesn't just tell us how bad life was for Louis in fact we
27:04
don't know much about his life outside the cannery but the player is forced to participate in this monotonous
27:10
suffocating environment for 10 minutes straight player agency is used to make
27:15
us feel the way that Louis does in the way that only a videogame can everything
27:20
is created to confront you with the claustrophobic stretches of real life you and Lewis are trapped in this eerily
27:27
dungeon-like room in the focuses never on wanting death instead Louis and the
27:34
player just end up wanting a way out a crucial distinction for suicidal
27:40
individuals that a lot of people just don't seem to understand this hell really does feel inescapable and
27:46
marching towards the light feels like a triumph with an orchestra cheering you on all of this is what makes what
27:53
remains of Edith Finch a fantastic example of Miller's informative game giving the player and authentic
27:59
emotional experience of that psychological state of suicidal ideation without even focusing on that particular
28:05
kind of realism Lewis never even speaks a single word to put it simply and
28:11
discussing hell-blade another game that uses a fictional analog to explore Schism affective disorders Aaron
28:17
supports rights although at its heart hell-blade is a third-person fantasy combat game it's striving for realism in the areas
28:24
that matter that someone might be offered an opportunity to guide a character suffering these experiences
28:30
and gain an understanding and empathy and that's the difference as I said before you
28:36
thie necessarily some unrealism will result in a misinformed empathy but
28:41
that's empathy nonetheless and I do think that representation is just as much about changing attitudes towards
28:47
one another as it is about accurately understanding one another too different
28:52
sometimes at odds but both very valuable aims after all claims of realism still
28:58
often exclude some certain fringe but real experiences that would undermine
29:03
those feelings of empathy I think it's just important to remember that video games are ultimately an art form and
29:11
that art is powerful so where does this
Conclusion
29:18
leave us my focus in this video has been first and foremost on empathy and I
29:24
think that's because I find fiction to be the closest thing we have to experiencing the reality of someone else
29:31
when we're all trapped inside these hard skulls of house and for some people
29:36
these skulls feel like prisons and maybe
29:41
just maybe video games might let us reach out just a little bit further and
29:47
for others it might make that prison just a little less claustrophobic
29:56
if we lived forever maybe we'd have time to understand things but as it is I
30:03
think the best we can do is try to open our eyes
30:09
appreciate how strange and brief all of this is I want you to be amazed that any
30:17
of us ever had a chance to be here at all this is where your story begins

Why Anime is for Black People - Hip Hop x Anime | Beyond the Bot,"180,348","15,000",9/25/20,18:34,"0:00
anybody who's been alive in the past 20
0:01
years has probably noticed a few
0:02
concurrent trends in popular culture
0:05
namely that anime has gone fully
0:06
mainstream hip-hop is now the largest
0:08
musical expert out of the united states
0:10
and politics at the federal level is
0:12
entertainment and always has been and
0:14
real change requires grassroots
0:15
community
0:16
organizing unless we be swept away in an
0:18
undercurrent of disillusionment when our
0:19
meaningless but necessary votes
0:21
once again yield exactly the results we
0:23
all know they will
0:24
thankfully i only be talking about two
0:26
of those things in this video
0:28
but i promise i'll do one on anime soon
0:36
the relationship between anime and hip
0:38
hop culture and in turn asian and black
0:40
american culture
0:41
is one that's been developing since the
0:42
70s and arguably before but i haven't
0:45
done the research to back up that claim
0:46
so i'm just going to start
0:47
by saying that as i've mentioned in
0:49
previous videos
0:50
asian media has permeated black culture
0:52
since the era of black exploitation
0:54
films
0:55
that drew heavily on the kung fu movies
0:57
that had been offloaded into black
0:58
theaters around the same time
1:00
which then gained popularity because the
1:02
two genres were the rare source of
1:04
reliably non-white protagonists
1:06
and similarly black culture has been a
1:08
fixture in japan for about as long as
1:10
america as a whole is that a presence in
1:12
the east
1:12
there's also maybe some conspiracy
1:14
theories about the race of the first
1:15
samurai but i definitely don't have the
1:16
time or mental energy to get into that
1:20
so there's a lot of coverage on this
1:21
subject across youtube
1:23
and from sources like vice mashable
1:25
pitchfork and genius shout out to
1:27
jacques morell who was supposed to do
1:28
this video with me before our
1:30
restructuring
1:31
but a lot of this discussion takes sort
1:32
of an a historical perspective and just
1:34
accepts rapper's love of anime as a
1:36
given with no prior context you can
1:38
point back to
1:39
so before i really dive in i want to
1:41
re-establish that as most of us know
1:43
the most vivid expression of
1:45
cross-cultural appreciation in hip-hop
1:47
came from the wu-tang clan
1:48
who built their sampling repertoire on a
1:50
foundation laid primarily by shaw
1:52
brothers studios
1:53
which produced kung fu films like the 36
1:55
chamber of shaolin
1:56
and shaolin and wu-tang from which the
1:58
group obviously drew its name but that
2:00
wasn't the first example of black
2:02
musicians taking inspiration from asian
2:04
art across genres artists claimed
2:06
japanese synth pop group yellow magic
2:07
orchestra as pivotal figures in modern
2:09
dance music
2:10
with sample credits from michael jackson
2:12
quincy jones two live crew
2:14
de la soul jennifer lopez mariah carey
2:16
and one of hip-hop's originators africa
2:18
bombata who once jokingly claimed that
2:21
the group who he sampled in his tape
2:22
death mix
2:23
might have invented hip-hop and we will
2:25
not talk about africa bombata
2:27
beyond that point also i realize i'm
2:29
bouncing back and forth between asian
2:31
countries here but
2:32
all this happened in a time period when
2:33
there wasn't really much distinction
2:35
made between china and the rest of asia
2:37
at least in casual conversation
2:38
so i think it's fair to assume some of
2:40
that cultural traffic just kind of got
2:41
blended together but the last
2:43
point to make here is that while anime
2:45
is the de facto successor to the era of
2:47
chinese kung fu films
2:48
there was already a precedent set in
2:50
hip-hop for the integration of japanese
2:52
music but this still doesn't explain how
2:53
we got to modern times
2:55
where most people wouldn't even bet an
2:56
eye at an anime reference in music
2:58
because if i'm to believe the hulu
3:00
series on the wu-tang clan
3:01
and the way people responded to riz's
3:03
var my mind flashed back to an early
3:05
moon when i was just a sperm cell and a
3:06
fallopian tube
3:07
then i am also to believe that any
3:10
unusual or left field lyric would have
3:12
shot
3:12
or confused the average hip-hop head
3:14
back in the day
3:16
so how did that change well the answer
3:18
will probably not surprise you at all a
3:20
lot of people say one of the first open
3:21
references to anime and hip-hop as lupe
3:24
fiasco's bar
3:24
guess who's on third lupe still like
3:26
lupin iii from his feature on kanye west
3:29
touched the sky off his late
3:30
registration album in 2005.
3:32
now lupon iii is a character with many
3:34
different appearances including in hayao
3:36
miyazaki's 1979 feature debut the castle
3:38
of cagliostro
3:40
and it would be simple enough to assume
3:42
that that's where lupe's reference comes
3:44
from but i feel like that's unlikely
3:45
given his age
3:46
not that people can't watch old movies
3:48
i've seen the kaguyo show but
3:50
lupe was born three years after the
3:52
film's release in 1982
3:54
so is it more likely that he knows the
3:56
character from there or that he knows it
3:58
from the much more recent release of
4:00
lupon the third part two the series that
4:02
was acquired by cartoon network in 2002
4:04
and aired on adult swim the next january
4:07
when lupe was 19.
4:08
i'm doing these unnecessary wikipedia
4:10
forensics simply to point to the fact
4:11
that as you probably predicted i believe
4:13
just about every
4:14
early connection to anime and hip-hop
4:16
with a few exceptions has a direct live
4:18
back to cartoon network one of those
4:19
exceptions of course is the case of
4:21
kanye west himself
4:22
who has publicly stated that his
4:23
favorite anime is akira
4:25
which was dubbed by streamlined pictures
4:26
in the us and animated by tms
4:28
entertainment who were also frequently
4:30
contracted on batman the animated series
4:32
which re-aired on cartoon network from
4:34
1998 to 2004
4:36
and toonami in 2005 but that's only an
4:39
indirect connection
4:40
so i think it's safe to say most people
4:42
who came of age in the late 90s and
4:44
early 2000s either discovered anime
4:46
or solidified their love of anime on
4:48
toonami where a cartoon network created
4:50
a complete ecosystem that hadn't been
4:52
seen before in the world of anime
4:53
localization now this is kind of just a
4:55
recap of video i did in the before times
4:57
but for context toonami was not the
5:00
first anime block on tv
5:02
but it was the first that effectively
5:04
demystified the style for american
5:06
audiences before this point networks and
5:08
production companies had
5:09
tried and failed to localize anime like
5:11
in the early days
5:12
when there were translations that
5:14
effectively erased the japanese origins
5:16
of the source material
5:17
because of we'll say post-war tensions
5:20
but once we were a little further
5:22
removed from pearl harbor programming
5:23
blocks on tv were still marred
5:25
by an othering view of anime that
5:27
relegated it to something foreign that
5:29
needed to be unpacked
5:31
not to mention americans still maintain
5:32
an attitude toward cartoons
5:34
that meant all the violence nudity and
5:36
profanity that we're accustomed to now
5:38
were regularly edited out to sell what
5:40
was practically
5:41
porn to children so tsunami was the
5:44
first to eschew that mindset
5:45
and prioritize the integrity of the work
5:47
and of course it paid off
5:49
it created a three-dimensional media
5:50
landscape that sold more mature cartoons
5:52
to his young viewers
5:54
and reviewed music and video games and
5:56
took on kind of a big brother role to
5:58
kids like me
5:58
who locked themselves in their rooms and
6:00
trusted the word of cgi robots
6:02
more than our own parents and that's uh
6:04
paid off
6:07
for me toonami also grew up alongside
6:10
its fans with frequent updates to its
6:12
host tom
6:12
whose death was aired as a fun little
6:15
interactive game that was probably a lot
6:16
of people's first experience with
6:18
mortality
6:20
it was my first experience with
6:21
mortality eventually toonami added its
6:23
late night iteration midnight run where
6:25
it aired even less edited anime and most
6:28
importantly to this particular essay
6:30
premiered music from artists like
6:31
gorillaz an anime inspired virtual band
6:33
who've collaborated with plenty of
6:35
rappers
6:36
including known anime fan del the funky
6:38
homo sapien
6:39
of hieroglyphics and deltron 3030 his
6:42
group with dan the automator who also
6:44
produced gorilla's self-titled debut owl
6:46
in deltron's debut dell in character as
6:49
deletron zero
6:50
paints a picture of a post-apocalyptic
6:52
dystopia where he himself is a
6:54
cybernetic anti-capitalist
6:55
and makes at least one reference to
6:57
anime when he raps dale i'm feeling like
6:59
a ghost in the show
7:00
i wrote this in jail playing host to a
7:02
cell and that bar predates lupe fiestas
7:05
by about five years
7:06
but then again dell who was a cousin of
7:09
ice cube
7:09
is also very deliberately off the beaten
7:11
path considering he cut
7:13
artistic ties with his cousin after
7:15
getting his help to produce
7:16
a pretty successful solo debut but i
7:19
digress
7:20
in 2001 midnight run also premiered the
7:23
first four episodes of daft punk's
7:25
interstellar 5555
7:27
an anime film helmed by legendary
7:28
director leiji matsumoto
7:30
and a visualization of the group's
7:32
second studio album discovery
7:34
inspired by matsumoto's manga captain
7:36
harlock these two releases helped build
7:37
toonami's reputation as taste makers but
7:40
midnight run which started in 2000 was
7:42
just a precursor to when we really
7:44
started to see the crossover between
7:45
anime and black music specifically
7:47
in september 2001 actually two months
7:50
before the midnight run special where
7:51
there's two pieces aired
7:53
cartoon network launched the anime side
7:54
of its adult swim block with arguably
7:57
the most memorable
7:58
anime op of all time cowboy bebop is one
8:00
of the most revered anime to ever reach
8:02
america by a director who's frequently
8:04
hailed as one of the most forward
8:05
thinking in all of anime
8:06
shinichiro watanabe now i personally
8:08
think his emphasis on not just diversity
8:10
for diversity's sake but on
8:12
fair and very not racist representation
8:14
of black people when they were featured
8:16
on the show
8:16
certainly didn't hurt his case with fans
8:18
who recognized the quality of the show's
8:20
jazz music
8:21
which he wanted to use as a thematic
8:22
foil against its futuristic background
8:24
that music was composed by yoko kano who
8:26
formed the band seatbelts specifically
8:28
to create the show's soundtrack and just
8:30
as an aside the main character spike's
8:32
fighting style is jeep condo which any
8:34
martial arts fan will recognize as the
8:35
style of
8:36
bruce lee just to tie that whole martial
8:38
arts
8:39
kung fu thread together that
8:42
bebop would serve as another genesis
8:44
point that would further establish the
8:45
precedent that cartoon network would
8:47
deliver on both anime and music and they
8:49
continued that trend with fully cooley
8:51
soundtrack by the pillows in 2003
8:53
which featured maybe one of the most
8:55
recognizable anime and themes of the
8:57
2000s
8:58
but it was another watanabe project that
9:00
drew black fans back in for more
9:02
with samurai shamplo watanabe wanted to
9:04
flip the script of bebop
9:05
and pair a story from the past with a
9:07
soundtrack from the future
9:09
so naturally he chose hip-hop to be the
9:11
driving sound of the show
9:13
and turned to a team of rappers and
9:14
producers including force of nature
9:16
fat john the ample soul physician
9:18
tsuchiye and most notably the late
9:20
nujabes
9:22
who tends to get all the credit for
9:23
shampoo's music and frankly i'm just
9:25
gonna
9:25
add to that nude along with j dilla is
9:28
considered a pioneer in lo-fi hip-hop
9:30
which you're probably familiar
9:31
with if you've ever had to relax and or
9:33
study and needed beats to go along with
9:35
that both artists are regularly cited by
9:37
rappers and producers as influences
9:39
while champloo is hailed as a touchstone
9:41
for just about every black person who
9:42
claims to be a fan of anime after
9:44
shampoo adult swim further synthesized
9:46
anime and hip-hop by taking a newspaper
9:49
comic strip and developing it into
9:50
possibly the most
9:51
openly anime inspired american show up
9:54
until that point
9:54
the boondocks premiered on adult swim in
9:56
november 2005
9:58
just under two years after samurai
9:59
shampoo's release and it drew on just
10:01
about everything anime had to offer up
10:03
until that point
10:04
contextualizing it all through a black
10:06
family living in an oppressively white
10:08
suburb now if you know the show you can
10:09
see its influences pretty clearly
10:11
the opening theme is performed by ashuru
10:13
and it mirrors the low five vibe of
10:15
samurai shamplus op pretty closely a
10:17
while black anime fans had already had
10:19
dragon ball z for years
10:20
the one-two punch of shampoo and the
10:22
boondocks confirmed what a lot of black
10:24
people had already believed
10:26
that we were anime's target audience and
10:28
the boondock supported that by
10:29
explicitly appealing to the black
10:31
community through its music and through
10:33
critiques of black culture and
10:34
institutions
10:35
that are generally best left for
10:37
intra-communal conversations
10:39
i.e when there are no white folks
10:41
present so while you can certainly
10:42
debate the boondocks legitimacy in the
10:44
anime space its existence especially
10:47
confirmed that the anime landscape as it
10:49
pertained to
10:50
americans was being crafted around black
10:52
viewership and then
10:54
for a full circle moment in 2007 afro
10:57
samurai premiered on spike tv
10:59
later on adult swim so it still counts
11:01
and featured a soundtrack by none other
11:03
than the originator of rap nerd
11:05
rizza of the wu tank clan the same man
11:08
who claimed dragon ball z was the story
11:09
of the black man in america
11:11
and who gets so beautifully excited by
11:13
anything anime or kung fu related
11:15
look at this got him in the heart in the
11:16
nuts oh he's going for the nuts he's
11:18
going for the nuts
11:19
nope no nuts kid he moved the nuts
11:22
afro samurai really just doubled down on
11:24
everything the boondocks had already
11:25
established
11:26
that anime is for black people and that
11:29
samuel l jackson has an incomparable
11:31
voice acting repertoire
11:33
don't follow me i'll fight you i don't
11:36
care
11:37
plus afro was actually produced by a
11:39
japanese company which gives it a little
11:41
extra legitimacy in comparison
11:43
so there's that so through all these
11:45
years from toonami
11:47
up to adult swim cartoon network put in
11:49
serious work building trust with its
11:50
black fans
11:51
but it also did a lot more direct
11:53
outreach in terms of music itself
11:55
i'm sure if you watch adult swim you're
11:57
familiar with its signature bumps
11:59
featuring music that is consistently
12:01
surprisingly dope well that's in part
12:03
because one of toonami's co-founders
12:05
jason demarco
12:06
now creative director and svp at adult
12:08
swim and who i've written about
12:10
before had to get deeply involved with
12:12
the network's music programming when
12:13
they realized the music library at
12:15
turner didn't exactly yield
12:17
the most consistent results and because
12:19
turner's mo even at toonami's inception
12:21
has always been to keep things cheap
12:23
the solution to that problem also had to
12:25
be financially viable
12:26
so demarco turned to independent record
12:28
labels for their musical talent
12:29
and among a few others developed a
12:31
relationship with brain feeder records
12:33
a label founded by flying lotus in 2008
12:36
which hosts artists like kamasi
12:37
washington
12:38
thundercat and george clinton of
12:40
parliament funkadelic so you can think
12:42
of the label in a couple ways either as
12:44
a cheap music option for anime nerds
12:46
or as an incubator for kendrick lamar
12:48
collaborators
12:50
i don't know it's up to you so that's
12:52
essentially what an entire
12:54
generation of anime fans are being
12:55
exposed to from the early 2000s until
12:57
now adult swim also had a brief stint as
12:59
a label itself
13:00
building off the success of its release
13:02
of danger dooms the mouse and the mask
13:04
a collaboration between gray album
13:06
producer and frequent adult swimming
13:08
associate
13:08
danger mouse and your favorite rapper's
13:10
favorite rapper mf duke who you might
13:12
know
13:12
uh now at for his reputation as a male
13:15
lauren hill
13:16
the album which featured cameos from
13:18
adult swim characters like master shake
13:20
brac and space ghost and laid the
13:22
foundation for later collabs like gnarls
13:24
barkley
13:25
proved incredibly successful and
13:27
prompted the opening of williams street
13:29
records soon after
13:30
william street released albums from
13:32
artists like killer mike and it's
13:33
possible that jason demarco actually
13:35
introduced the atl rapper to his future
13:37
run the jewels partner lp
13:39
the label eventually bottomed out
13:40
because it just didn't have the
13:41
infrastructure to operate in the
13:43
traditional manner
13:44
but it's continued to license new music
13:46
from independent artists to introduce
13:48
through the adult swim singles program
13:50
which now releases a new track once a
13:52
week 52 weeks a year and has included
13:54
artists like zaytoven
13:56
death grips and flying lotus who all sit
13:58
in jarringly different lanes in the
14:00
hip-hop world it's also worth noting
14:02
that chance the rapper would later gain
14:03
a huge following
14:04
similarly releasing music for free on
14:06
soundcloud and also dropping the
14:08
occasional dragon ball z reference
14:10
so now we live in a landscape where
14:11
mainstream artists do generally drive
14:13
the conversation toward their anime
14:15
fandom with kanye remaking tetsuo's
14:17
hospital escape in the stronger video
14:19
and frank ocean using majin buu as a
14:22
thinly veiled but still
14:24
exceedingly artistic analogy
14:29
but it's the independent or otherwise
14:31
left field artist who really wear their
14:33
fandom on their sleeve
14:34
with rappers like open mic eagle little
14:36
peep and denzel curry
14:37
referencing death note in their work or
14:39
saw baby releasing his project squid
14:41
tastic in 2018 which features the track
14:44
anime world
14:45
which heavily references naruto and
14:47
includes a shout out to nujabes
14:49
and then of course there's still people
14:50
like british rapper skarlord
14:52
who can most effectively be described as
14:54
the rizza
14:55
of tokyo ghoul creating an entire
14:57
artistic persona
14:59
around the show's main character ken
15:00
kaneki
15:03
so this has been my attempt at
15:05
comprehensively explaining the roots of
15:07
the hip hop and anime phenomenon
15:09
and i still haven't even scratched the
15:11
surface considering there's plenty of
15:13
anime like masaki yuasa's double man
15:15
crybaby
15:16
that reciprocate the love from the
15:17
hip-hop community and considering i've
15:19
paid
15:20
embarrassingly little credence to the
15:22
rise of female rappers in recent years
15:24
like baby mother who sports a notable
15:26
crescent moon tattoo on her forehead
15:29
and most significantly megan the
15:30
stallion who has gone so far as doing an
15:32
ig live interview
15:33
about her love of anime with
15:35
crunchyroll's tim lu who to this day i
15:37
will not forgive for not giving me a
15:39
heads up
15:41
you know what you did tim megan blew up
15:42
off the strength of her freestyles on
15:44
instagram but myself and many of her
15:46
fans also appreciate her open love of
15:48
anime
15:49
and her cosplay of characters like bulma
15:51
and todoroki whose hot cold powers also
15:53
serve as a perfect representation of
15:55
both her hot girl fan base and persona
15:57
and her alter ego tina snow but i don't
16:00
know i've been writing for mad long and
16:01
i think this might merit its own video
16:03
so considering i also work for
16:05
crunchyroll maybe i'll see if i can cop
16:07
my own interview
16:08
and unpack megan's love of anime in
16:09
depth but in the meantime i'm yodoye and
16:12
this is whatever outro we've mutually
16:14
agreed upon
16:16

What Is *Good* Queer Representation in 2020?,"181,933","12,000",8/14/20,48:21,"0:00
this was actually a really difficult video to write because what queer fandom is means so many
0:07
things and is so different for every individual we don't choose which characters we end
0:15
up having emotional connections with or end up awakening our queerness for so
0:21
long we were limited as subtext as the other so there is a long rich
0:28
and often necessary legacy and history of looking to straight but other
0:34
characters and seeing the queerness seeing the queer possibilities
0:40
in them that were not allowed to be either because of censorship or because of
0:46
inept writers who continue to queerbait now in 2020 we have gotten
0:51
in the past five to ten years some of the most groundbreaking lgbtq
0:56
representations and according to glad the representation we see in films and television keeps
1:04
breaking new milestones what does that mean for queer fandom today where we no longer need to rely on just
1:11
subtext where characters even in children's television cartoons can be overtly queer
1:20
and we're allowed to talk about queerness without it being a special moment it's just part of the dialogue you're
1:27
all kinds of awesome but you should know something you like me as a friend yes because
1:35
i'm gay in looking at queer fandom today especially in the post klexa world
1:43
i think it's important to examine the milestones we have
1:48
achieved because they are important and what it means now that queerness is somewhat
1:55
normalized in the media but at the same time there are still so many who are underrepresented in our
2:01
communities and within the margins of queerness who is being left behind
2:06
who is being elevated and now that we have so much representation with queer
2:13
writers being behind the scenes telling these stories how do we discuss what is good
2:21
representation that accepts the fact that what it means to be queer
2:26
is not a monolithic experience and that it should at times be allowed to be as
2:32
messy as heterosexual relationships and heterosexual storylines well well we're gonna get into it just
2:38
me and good old dorothy parker lego the queerbaiting era
2:45
growing up in the internet proper in the 2010s queer baiting had evolved into a
2:52
very complicated issue especially in a lot of the
2:57
major fandoms especially super who lock if you don't know what
3:04
that is you're so lucky this was an era i remember clearly because it was my childhood had
3:12
had a bunch of really big men love men couples that were really
3:17
popular in fandom that was your wincest your john locke your martha your steric
3:24
your dean and castile all the classics this is an era that is hard for me
3:29
to speak about dispassionately for the sake of the nuance that i like
3:34
to bring i want to clarify one thing i don't have any
3:40
inherent bias against these ships i get the appeal i get why people are into them and if
3:47
you ship any of these relationships blessed be i just want to make sure that we are
3:54
on that same page before we get to the critical lens because you can
4:00
ship something and really enjoy it while being critical of the issues that are present in it at
4:07
least i hope so what i struggle with a lot when it comes to this topic
4:13
is wanting to have empathy to those who see something important in these ships who
4:20
see them as true potential representation
4:25
for them and who often feel as if writers creators etc are marketing
4:32
to them in a disingenuous way no one should be treated as crazy
4:39
for shipping two men together gay relationships in shows should not
4:46
be inherently seen as crack shipping just because it's queer that is
4:53
dismissive and reductive and gross that is not okay that being said somehow advocating for
5:01
these ships also led to a hotbed of sexism and racism within sections
5:08
of these fandoms not from everyone but it was a significant part
5:14
of a lot of people's experiences within dealing with these ships
5:20
the fact that in cases these two dudes did not end up together would be placed on the heads of their
5:26
female love interests and god help you if that female love interest
5:31
was also a woman of color especially a black woman what is worse is that in
5:37
order to give the fans what they wanted but still no homo everything it would lead to
5:44
bizarre decisions like the fact that in season five of merlin arthur
5:52
and gwen don't share a single kiss in the final season of that show even though they are married not
6:00
one kiss and every season that they had been in a
6:05
relationship they had had at least one big kiss it was
6:11
bananas b-a-n-a-n-a-s and i know we could talk about a lot of men loving men
6:17
relationships here but i'm gonna pick starrick
6:22
because i have experiences in the teen wolf fandom teen wolf was a
6:29
very interesting experience i got into the show when it was in the middle of its second
6:35
season because everyone was like surprised it's actually really good
6:41
i watched it religiously until they killed allison i will never forgive them i will never
6:47
forget them i know they brought her back for one episode but i choose never to forgive derek was a [ __ ] that i saw hide all
6:54
over the tag so i was like okay okay here we go we're gonna have some hot you know hot boy on boy werewolf
7:02
action it's going to be interesting and initially my opinions on teen wolf were
7:07
very prosteric pro styles and i was a little bit
7:12
about scott and allison that is the documented fact of my tumblr since i
7:17
have seen people go through my tumblr to check these issues every time i bring up how my
7:24
opinions have changed then as i began to enter the fandom properly
7:29
as you know i was getting into the second season i began to notice a few things the complete
7:37
erasure of scott as a mexican heroic lead and why that mattered something that still continues
7:44
to happen to this day with people nitpicking his mexican representation
7:50
status despite the fact that the reality is tyler posey is himself half mexican has always said
7:56
that he considers scott to be a mexican and that should in this case
8:02
be enough because it's a real person it's not like in star wars is the forces of evil where
8:07
the voice actor is in mexican so there isn't even that layer of it scott is mexican that is important to
8:14
have a chicano you know all-american
8:19
hero type people also never ever really mentioned the actual gay male
8:26
character on the show danny i need to have sex like right now someone needs to have sex with me like today like someone needs to sex me
8:32
right now all right i'll do it boom [Music] what come to my place at nine plan to
8:39
say the night i like to cuddle who was not only a gay man but a gay native hawaiian
8:48
man so that polynesian representation of queerness was not seen as
8:54
important and not talked about to the point where it was actually happening on the show i was like huh
9:01
i didn't even know there was a mechanically gay character on this show i thought that it was going to be stiles
9:07
and derek and then it wasn't these before times are what
9:13
shape my feelings now as an adult in a lot of ways in terms of queer rep because i remember
9:19
what it was like to see two sides of my identity be in conflict on shows that were trying to
9:27
represent both sides my queerness and my brownness and having to choose sides because of
9:32
fandom even if i liked starrick the racism against scott the way that staric fans talked about
9:40
characters of color made me ultimately uninterested in supporting those things
9:46
the reason why i wanted to start with this particular topic is not because i'm trying to pinpoint
9:52
the toxicity on just a few kinds of shifts no because it's an all
9:58
problem but sort of examine that this is the place of queer baiting of wanting certain couples
10:04
to happen especially with white men that take precedent
10:10
over the representation of other marginalized people within the queer community it is
10:17
exhausting because while people are spending all of this fandom energy getting
10:24
those relationships to happen actual queer characters get left behind actual queer representation gets
10:32
left behind what's even more so is that i don't think we have really moved on collectively past this time
10:41
it has not been an easy journey to this place of less dead queer people and less
10:48
queerbaiting so a lot of us are still on edge about it making sure that we are getting representation
10:54
and a lot of us are also getting more specific about what we want
11:00
and that's important too we still unfortunately do not have as many
11:06
male queer relationships as there could be this is obviously a flaw however what does it
11:13
mean that despite wanting that despite needing that the relationships that are
11:20
canonically between gay queer men are not as elevated as the relationships between
11:26
straight men that people want to be queer and who's shipping those characters it doesn't
11:32
disvalue it but it is just something to keep in mind when we're talking about what it means
11:38
to have queer discourse when kurosawami changed the world from 2013 onwards we began to see
11:46
the transformation of queer characters from not just supporting players but
11:53
to leads documents britannia holstein and many many others as you can
11:59
probably notice these are mostly women loving women relationships december 19
12:05
2014 the world in my opinion really shifted when korrasami became
12:12
canon what now back to the dance floor i'm kind of all danced out honestly
12:18
after everything that's happened the past few months i could use a vacation let's do it
12:24
let's go on a vacation just the two of us anywhere you want really okay i've always wanted to see
12:32
what the spirit world's like there is a lot of discussion about if korrasami
12:38
is good representation or not let me just say my piece here
12:45
as the one wearing the kori sami t-shirt in this particular video i do not think
12:51
the legend of korra is a consistently good show it has nothing to do
12:57
with me wanting it to be avatar the last airbender i have plenty of critiques of that show
13:03
too it just doesn't have as strong of a narrative for a number of reasons if you want me
13:10
to get more into that i think i already have but i could now that being said in book three breit
13:15
claimed that they wanted to start moving towards korrasami we see them
13:21
growing closer than both leaving mako behind amen of course at this time there were
13:27
not many or any canonically lgbtq animated couples for
13:33
children so when a lot of us were watching korrasami happen we never thought it was
13:39
a possibility because at that point it couldn't be most of the time it was
13:46
subtext like bubbling and the show had been taken off of television at this point and put
13:53
on nick.com and breg did in my opinion the most they could as a queer person as a bisexual woman
14:01
the ending was clear and i was gobsmacked i could not believe
14:08
that it had happened it meant something to me and to many others because
14:13
now we could say that there were canonically bisexual characters
14:20
on a nickelodeon television show for children that ended up together they may not have kissed but that moment
14:28
was more than a kiss it was a shift in the paradigm
14:33
having the spin-off to one of the greatest shows of our generation end up with two
14:41
bisexual women of color as the end game was a groundbreaking moment
14:46
despite the sort of subtextual messy way that we got to that place which we will get into
14:53
at a later time this happened a year before klexa became a thing and took place
14:59
three months after the finale of lost girl which ended up with
15:04
beau and lauren making out in a very odd position on top of a car
15:11
a human lauren lewis want to spend the rest of my life with you
15:18
succubus oh dennis
15:26
for me this period was the era where i felt the change begin to happen as a
15:32
bisexual woman that we could be in this place where queer relationships could just
15:39
be the story be the text the heroes we got things like carmilla
15:45
orphan black the canonical queerness of bubbling adventure time
15:53
everything going on with shira steven universe craig in the creek you know all of that is important what
15:59
is even more impressive is the fact that now more than ever
16:05
we have lgbtq people behind the scenes working on these stories noel stevenson
16:13
and rebecca sugar are two non-binary queer people working on two of the greater shows of
16:19
all time despite ryan murphy himself a gay man being on the tin of pose it is a work of janet mock and
16:26
other black queer trans writers this shift is especially important because we get writers who
16:34
understand how to explore queerness without exploiting it
16:41
without always needing to center in awkward ways that give us the fullness of these
16:48
lives not just the talking points that that non-queer people want to see
16:53
of course it doesn't mean that it's perfect pose is trailblazing but there is still colorism with the way that
16:59
candy was treated before and after she died leaving elektra who is
17:05
a queen as the sole dark-skinned black female representation on the show that's still a problem trans men are
17:12
still largely absent on the show and media in general despite having a place in balram culture and just
17:19
trans culture in general and that is because of the people getting to tell
17:25
these stories yet even in this space we still have a lot of erasure and it's important to bring that up not
17:32
to pin one against the other but to discuss why
17:37
certain people and certain peoples within the queer community are much easier to commodify than others
17:44
it isn't a shame about our identities our identities are still valid because we are people but when companies want to treat us like
17:51
a brand it's important to think about who is getting elevated
17:56
not only by television but by the fandom the consumers of this media who gets
18:02
left behind once upon a time was the bane of my existence for a really
18:07
long time it was a show that i felt coasted on the goodwill of its lgbtq fan
18:13
base and first two seasons for so long and still ended up being one of the most
18:20
heteronormative shows i had ever experienced in my entire life
18:26
the show had promised to give us an lgbtq relationship for ages now for those who may not know
18:33
the biggest ship at the time in that fandom was swan queen which was emma swann and regina
18:41
mills aka the evil queen who is to this day still one of the greatest all-time characters
18:47
even though sometimes people would forget that the evil queen is puerto rican now sadly this was a
18:53
relationship that would have obviously happened if one of them
18:58
was a cis-head male because it all lined up in this very domestic way but
19:05
both characters still ended up really getting put with two in my opinion annoyingly generic white
19:11
dudes the show was never that bold but you know who was there just
19:19
waiting to be iconic queer representation [Music]
19:33
sleeping warrior mulan was explicitly bisexual and had sapphic tension with ruby
19:41
with merida with aurora yet when that time finally came for them to be a canonical
19:47
woman love woman couple on the show do you know what happened
19:53
they made it ruby and dorothy a character that we had
19:59
literally spent no time with but of course it was dorothy from the wizard of oz because
20:06
friend of dorothy is a thing but it's like still come on and what's frustrating about
20:13
this thing is that despite the fact that there have been plenty of amazing women of color queer
20:21
ships the majority of the ones you see promoted and celebrated in
20:26
fandom outside of anime are white our cis are thin able-bodied and femme
20:33
presenting i was looking at this image during pride and it was an image of katridora
20:39
korosame and supercorp my issue was this was not with the ship itself because i get
20:46
the appeal of it and let's face it katie mcgrath has chemistry with women it's her gift she's the irish piper
20:53
peribo like that's what she does
20:58
my issue is that in a post that was celebrating important canonical women loving women couples you
21:04
had two canonical interracially coded ones and then you had super corp which is not
21:11
only fannin and non-canonical but it's on a
21:16
show where there's an actual healthy lesbian relationship
21:24
alex and kelly's relationship on supergirl is actually really good it's been one of
21:30
my favorite episodes of the show besides dreamer because neonal is amazing i totally appreciate
21:36
that kelly is this gentle caring person who acts with emotional maturity
21:42
and empathy they communicate about their problems they are on the same page about
21:47
things they are really remarkable representation
21:52
however there is like negative hype for them in the tags and in the community
21:59
especially when you compare it to how hard people went for
22:05
maggie and alex which is a problem for a lot of reasons when
22:11
maggie and alex were a couple sanvers was their name people loved them i saw art for them
22:18
everywhere they were super popular i would see them all the time when i would go to flame con there is that for
22:24
alex and kelly where is that for anissa and grace in black lightning where is that love even for dreamer
22:33
nia herself or around the writing for nia and brainy in which you have
22:38
a trans woman in a relationship with a character who is played by an indian
22:45
actor you know where is that for elena and her partner in one day at a time where is that for
22:52
nomanita know me marx
22:58
will you marry me oh my god oh my god
23:07
what
23:14
i'm gonna need a kaplan will you marry me when winona earp and
23:22
one day at a time were both up for cancellation the lengths at which
23:27
people went to protect wynonna earp were astounding i loved that show so i
23:35
was super happy about it and now one day at a time airs on pop tv
23:40
have you seen people talking about it veda has been cancelled despite it
23:46
having really groundbreaking and important chicana representation and if they cancel pose that's basically
23:53
it for black trans folk representation in television not to mention there are
23:59
very few trans men non-binary folk and
24:04
where there are they are mostly often white according to glaad the racial
24:10
diversity of lgbtq characters saw another significant decrease this year so in a year that
24:16
glad calls record-breaking in terms of film we still see almost non-existent
24:23
representation for those who live outside the white cis able-bodied lg world
24:31
although i will say i do take issue with glad deciding not to count hustlers and john wick 3
24:39
in their count what is good queer representation as i said before being queer is not a
24:45
monolithic experience even as a bisexual black woman there are
24:50
times i'll hear people talk about stuff within the bisexual
24:55
spectrum and i'll just be like that sounds a little sus but okay there
25:02
will never be a single character that will ever perfectly encapsulate
25:07
what your experience is what your relationship to your identity is personally what do
25:14
i consider good representation well well written not perpetuating
25:21
stereotypes broadens the spectrum while bringing something
25:26
new and interesting to the table and bonus points if written and created by a person within the community
25:33
you will note that nothing in there says healthy authentic or that i personally enjoy it
25:41
labeling a fictional relationship as toxic has become a really cheap way to say
25:50
a lot while saying very little while i do think it is important
25:56
for fictional relationships to not perpetuate problematic romances
26:05
i think at the same time there is this expectation that relationships between
26:13
queer people have no conflict especially on shows with a supernatural
26:21
and fantastic bent that just seems really unrealistic to me and
26:27
unproductive from a writing standpoint one of my favorite couples of all time
26:34
is bulma and vegeta from dragon ball vegeta started off in dragon ball z as a mass
26:41
murderer who killed bulma's then boyfriend and her best friends now they are
26:48
married with two kids and are straight up domestic goals you know vegeta is team dad with piccolo who also
26:55
used to be a warmonger so you know it's not like it's
27:02
unprecedented heterosexual couples get to be messy and be otp and couple goals and i think it is fair
27:09
to ask for that same standard to be set when it's appropriate for queer couples now that being said we should
27:16
absolutely have standards there are issues with how a lot of
27:22
people especially when they're not queer have written queer couples one thing that does irritate me is that a lot of couples that i have
27:28
watched was how often one partner is keeping some sort of secret from
27:35
their other partner while they have a sexual relationship and that secret isn't like
27:41
a small thing it's a super important one you see this with bo and lauren in lost girl where the first time they
27:47
have sex is with some consent issues because lauren is technically
27:53
kind of honey potting her even though lauren also wanted to sleep with her anyway but
28:00
she's working with the ash in order to keep beau from doing something that could further ash's plans
28:05
and it is a very traumatic experience with orphan black delphine
28:10
who is also a blond scientist is keeping secrets from cosima about
28:17
part of her cloneness and buffy the vampire slayer slayer
28:22
slayer willow mind wipes tara after they have broken up and they get back
28:27
together and they have a sexual relationship that's not fully consensual these are things to be
28:33
critical on and while i ultimately love docubus and think that tensions between them are what
28:41
made them compelling it was also just frustrating that at times
28:46
how lauren was often framed as the more difficult choice in comparison to her
28:54
male counterpart dyson and for some of you who might be saying well what about tamzin i don't like tams
29:02
sorry valkybish shippers feel free to yell at me in the comments below while i personally never enjoyed orange
29:09
is the new blacks piper alex relationship at the same time it was interesting it
29:15
was at the forefront of the show and wasn't any messier than any of the
29:21
other relationships that were going on it was like authentically queer mess and that is
29:27
for some people good representation and if the writers are aware that this relationship has
29:35
toxic elements and they are exploring it then that's putting
29:41
this queer relationship on equal footing narratively with countless heterosexual
29:47
relationships that do the exact same thing now and i know how this can
29:53
be construed so i want to make this very clear it is fine to not ship something because
30:00
for you it is personally triggering because you find it to be upsetting or because you
30:05
simply don't like it but when we're talking about what makes good representation taste is taste and there are things that
30:13
i may not have found interesting but we're good representation for example um pousse when she was
30:21
dating that girl in orange's new black i forget her name i think her name was so-so
30:26
they were cute they weren't something that i necessarily shipped but i would always retweet them because
30:31
i was like hey an interracial couple with no white people between two queer women like it was
30:37
beautiful i appreciate it for what it was didn't like any fire in my loins but that's okay good for it doesn't
30:44
always have to mean that it's perfect good representation should be allowed to be more complicated because
30:50
life is complicated we should hold our creators to standards absolutely and we should hold them
30:56
accountable when we think that they are promoting problematic and harmful behaviors without any sort of
31:02
understanding of what makes it problematic however we need to stop acting as though
31:09
being queer means there is nothing complicated about it we live complicated lives we have complicated relationships
31:16
as much as we want and deserve to have positive sweet saccharine lovey-dovey rep
31:23
we should also be allowed to have messy problematic representation i thought it was super
31:30
bizarre to me when it came to things like holstein where they'd be like carmilla is an abuser because she's
31:35
manipulative carmilla is a vampire vampires are inherently manipulative
31:41
in any vampire romance there is always some element of manipulation why would that
31:46
be any different because they're queer
31:53
wow so you're a giant black cat huh
32:01
anyway feel free to disagree because i don't as i said before i do not think my opinions are the end all be all but food for thought just wanted to
32:10
put it out there because i know i'm critical but i try to be critical in a fair way and as someone who has
32:16
had relationships stick in her crawl i get it i get when you have a when you see a couple you're just like i just don't
32:23
[ __ ] with this and that's okay but when we want to start saying that if you ship this and you're
32:29
a bad queer person and our issues are taste based and not in terms of the actual
32:34
content i found myself through bisexual characters in media
32:41
i found my bisexuality there especially when black characters who were bisexual came up but
32:47
the reason we asked for numbers while we asked for diverse representation is because we
32:53
need to see all the possibilities of who we can be it is great that we have choney on
33:00
riverdale but what does that mean if tony is underwritten what's the point
33:05
of having kevin on riverdale if he always has the same storyline every single time we have villain eve on
33:12
killing eve but the white writers room has no idea how to
33:17
address the complexities of eve's korean background unless sandra oh does it her damn self
33:24
when i think of the asexual people that i love in my life i don't see any of them really
33:31
represented in the asexual media when it happens asexual characters hardly already exist
33:38
in media and therefore without knowing one personally how do we learn about asexuality and the
33:44
spectrum sadly that is left up to the media the media and queerness are linked that's why these glad
33:52
reports come out before i ever met a trans person in my real day-to-day life i was first
33:59
exposed to transness through media which considering the era i grew up in was
34:04
hella problematic and terrifying and dangerous but that's why we advocate for better
34:10
representation not because we need to have perfect wish fulfillment characters
34:16
but to continue the work of humanizing lgbtq lives
34:22
and our complexities and our intersections i had the opportunity about a little
34:30
over a year ago to be part of a documentary called queering the script what was so important about it was getting to
34:36
discuss what queer fandom has done to help promote representation
34:42
and as we go forward as a fandom with so much power with so much consumer
34:47
power it is important to think about where we pour energy into are we really advocating for
34:53
an intersectional change do we use our fandom to communicate and celebrate all the vast sense of
35:00
queer identity or do we get caught pigeonholed into celebrating the norms we all have
35:06
to deal with this i have to deal with it i have to deal with that all the time and i don't make this video to
35:14
specifically call any particular relationships because there are a lot of issues we do need more gay male relationships
35:22
being made canon we need those to be a run and celebrated but we have to be careful that even
35:28
those of us who are queer are not fetishizing and weaponizing other queer realities
35:34
being queer and fandom is not easy a lot of the time we are being forced to do work and explain
35:40
ourselves in a way that is often not fair we don't have all the answers a lot of us are just figuring out who we are
35:46
i am brought up my way hot mug so that you guys can know that i come in peace
35:52
i originally had a completely different conclusion set up for this video but with
35:57
everything that's been going on in the 100 fandom i figured my discussion of that was
36:02
probably the best conclusion i could come up with for this video and even though i didn't write it out i
36:07
i felt like it would come off stronger if i just spoke from the heart and so this is what i
36:14
have to say about everything that's been going on in the earthdam right now i have been a fan of winona er pretty
36:19
much since it came out i really love the show i think that it's overall really funny and i think that
36:28
everyone is coming into this from with the best intent however i think that one of the things
36:35
that gets really difficult when we're talking about queer representation and talking about the flaws that exist within it is that people then
36:44
act as though the bar is perfection and i think that that's really unfair
36:51
and context matters and it's hard when you're coming in as a person of color
36:56
as a fat woman as a marginalized person within a marginalized community trying to express the desire
37:04
for more and it's true it is if you want something perfect especially
37:11
when that's not the case and i thought a perfect comparison of this was and i'm sorry to always bring it up
37:17
but shira because i did defend shira in its final season because there were
37:22
some people saying that it was easy to have katrina happen because it's two women and that scene is easier
37:29
and i felt like that statement really ignored a lot of context about the show that the show is made for children that
37:36
it has been historically harder to get same-sex couples on an animated series and that
37:43
it is a very big deal to have the titular lead of a show be a lesbian and have one of
37:50
the core conflicts in that show be between her and her girlfriend that regardless of if you like catrodor
37:56
or not is very historically important add on to that with confirmation from
38:02
noel stevenson that catra is someone who you could read as a mixed race woman of
38:07
color which you know the blacks clocked that on top of it what made me
38:13
more defensive of shiro was that overall if you look at what shira did
38:18
from the cast from the voice cast to the crew to the writers room you saw a lot of diversity in
38:26
shira you have a lesbian lead you have a lesbian you know mixed race
38:33
black uh co-lead you have a fat or chubby you can call glimmer fat or
38:39
chubby either one who is asian you have a very you know could be read bisexual
38:46
but or straight either way very confident his sexuality black character in bow who is in an
38:52
interracial relationship with said chubby asian character you have
38:57
a lesbian character which features a fat woman who is loved and cared for and
39:03
is giving you super wind power and her black girlfriend you have another
39:09
relationship featuring women of color you have multiple characters of color in the main cast
39:14
you have a canonically gay black couple that has many children and a happy marriage and they're not
39:20
stereotypes at all you have another lesbian couple
39:25
featuring a character that could be read as trans or non-binary but also just a really good character and another really
39:31
sweet lovingly platonic um lesbian couple and also
39:36
could be read as asexual um and as an asexual romantic couple you also have an a
39:43
relationship between relationship between a woman who's on the who's coded as being on the spectrum
39:48
who is in love with a character who is written as chronically ill with disabilities you
39:54
have a non-binary character voiced by a genderqueer voice actor
40:00
you have a background cast that is full of diversity you have a writer's room
40:05
that is filled with diversity even though shiva doesn't hit every single beat it
40:12
is giving you a lot of diversity it has more hits than it has misses which is

"Fallout: New Vegas Is Genius, And Here's Why","9,754,066","251,000",12/19/20,1:37:41,"0:00
- The first two ""Fallouts"" are still two of the best games ever. Two of the most engaging worlds and stories ever crafted
0:06
for players to explore. [dramatic music] So the developer went bankrupt. [booming]
0:12
The ""Fallout"" intellectual property was then sold to Bethesda. There were those who had minor problems
0:17
with the direction they took the series. - [screaming] - But when you shoot a guy just right, his guts go everywhere!
0:23
So overall the game did very well. A lot of people liked ""Fallout 3.""
0:28
Then again, a lot of people liked ""Clerks II,"" so humans aren't really viable as a species. But then less than two years later,
0:35
""Fallout"" cheated death. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪
0:41
Developed by Obsidian Entertainment with a team including people who worked on the original games, ""Fallout: New Vegas"" represents everything great
0:48
about the original series along with all the good stuff from ""3"" that was worth keeping. In addition to being one of the most
0:53
incredible games ever made, it's also really interesting to talk about from a design perspective. It's not just a game.
0:59
It's a flipping game design doctor, and it's here to put on a clinic. I didn't write that line. It just appeared in the script.
1:05
""New Vegas"" is the sort of game where you can open a manhole cover expecting, like, a sewer level, and instead discover that the local people have formed
1:12
a cult dedicated to blood and retrofitted the sewers into a fighting arena. Come on, there has to be a boring quest here.
1:19
Okay, the lady who runs this place wants me to find her some mantis eggs. ""Fetch some eggs."" That's gotta be the most boring quest there could possibly be.
1:26
Okay, the eggs are in this abandoned vault. Great, looking for eggs in some gray corridors. That sounds--wait, it's overgrown with plants,
1:33
and there's environmental storytelling warning me not to go in. Oh, man. This vault is cool.
1:38
It's overgrown and there's a bunch of stories on the computers about the experiments that went on in there, and it's creepy and way more
1:44
visually interesting than you'd expect a vault to be and is that--ah! Ah-- [upbeat music]
1:51
[tense music] ♪ ♪ One of ""New Vegas's"" best features
Part One: Creating Player Engagement
1:57
is its ability to make you invested in it's quests and locations. Vault 22 is one of the many parts of the world
2:03
that sounds on paper like somewhere familiar which then goes out of its way to be completely unlike you expect in every possible way.
2:09
Players of three will already have an intimate awareness of how vaults can be, having been forced to walk around for an hour
2:15
before the game even starts, and several side quests also take place in very similar vaults with slightly different aesthetics
2:22
and different enemies in them. Instead of Officer Mack, you get Officer Gary. - Gary!
2:28
- The most interesting vault in ""3"" is full of people called Gary who yell Gary at you. - [laughing] Gary!
2:34
[laughing] - I mean, it's pretty funny. On a surface level, it's easy to see why Vault 22 is a more compelling place to explore.
2:41
It's a bit nicer to look at with its spots of overgrowth in the halls and plants everywhere, the cave network it gives way to in its more run-down areas,
2:47
and it's populated with enemies unique to this one location called spore carriers which look like humans
2:52
but creepily hide in foliage and can't be targeted by V.A.T.S. while they're hiding, meaning you have to be able to spot them
2:58
through their camouflage in order to fight them which makes them genuinely creepy and--ah! And while the unique aesthetic and cool enemies are fun,
3:05
what makes Vault 22 a good case study in Obsidian's design philosophy is the way it creates a strong narrative experience for players
3:12
and uses its mechanical elements to enhance player engagement with the story. Firstly, just for convenience's sake,
3:18
the vault can be discovered in more than one way. Six different quests lead you to this vault. You don't necessarily come here looking for those delicious eg--
3:26
One guy wants you to find the secret of how they're growing all these plants so easily since, you know, growing plants in the Wasteland
3:31
is a pretty big deal. Somewhere on a computer system in the vault are files on how they managed all this, but on your way out of his office,
3:37
another scientist stops you and says, ""He's sent, like, 10 other guys there already and none of them have come back,""
3:42
and asks you to find out what happened to another researcher who went there. This is a trick the game pulls often with its quests.
3:48
Even something as simple as, ""Download some files for me, please,"" is given extra layers of narrative meaning.
3:53
You're actually being sent to a dangerous place without proper warning and other people are missing there. This creates a sense of anticipation to the level.
4:01
The vault has tons of computer logs detailing the work they did, the events with mind-controlling spores that led to everyone's death or infection,
4:07
and a bunch of new logs left by the researcher who went missing when she came here, and because you're actually trying to find out what happened
4:13
to the researcher, it's much harder to ignore the story that's going on here than it would be otherwise. The player is also being given mechanical rewards
4:20
that really incentivize exploring and engaging closely with the material. There's a unique laser rifle you can't get anywhere else
4:27
in the game hidden in this vault on some poor guy's corpse. The game never draws attention to it. It's not like a reward you get for beating a boss or something.
4:35
It's just hidden in a corner somewhere, and the genius of this kind of design is that once players have found something like this once,
4:41
they're gonna realize there could be stuff hidden anywhere. Suddenly they're paying that much more attention to the environments that they're traveling through
4:47
and partaking more in the stories of the place. You might not really care that much about the story of little side quests like this,
4:53
but if you know there might be a cool gun in here somewhere, you're paying a lot more attention than you might have been. Some of the quests technically put
4:59
an objective marker in the corner leading you to the necessary part, but when Vault 22 has worked its magic,
5:05
you forget it's there. The true beauty of great game design is when all its artificial justifications--
5:10
quest indicators, loot to find, experience points to earn-- melt away, and you really feel like you're in a creepy place
5:18
looking for answers. Eventually you find the researcher is alive and can help them flood the lower floors with gas
5:24
and blow up the spores so they don't pose a threat to anyone else. [flames roaring] - Good. You survived.
5:30
- Then she decides to delete the computer records. The person you optionally saved as a result of exploring
5:36
wants to delete the data you actually came here for. If you already downloaded it, she asks you to delete your copy, too,
5:42
so this mistake can't be repeated, and if you refuse, she attacks you. Even simple-seeming fetch quests have twists
5:49
and the sense of a story you're taking part in and making choices about, because there's a real moral dilemma here.
5:55
Do you really trust this guy with research that killed a bunch of people already? - We're with the government, for goodness sake.
6:01
Have a little faith in us. [gun cocking] [groans] - You have to be good at science in order to reason out with her that it's probably good
6:07
to have a record of the mistake so people don't repeat it. What could have been a simple fetch quest to find some data ended in making an ethical decision
6:15
about whether the information you found deserves to exist. The advantages to this design are clear when you contrast
6:21
with the Gary vault in ""3."" The enemies are kind of cool for a little while but there's no quests or story or choices to make,
6:28
so the experience isn't particularly involving. You don't really have any reasons to be here. There's a really useful piece of loot in this vault--
6:35
a bobble head that permanently increases your charisma-- and even though it's technically quite hard to miss-- it's just sitting on a table deep in the vault--
6:42
getting to it requires trolling through the rest of a location that has nothing else worth finding
6:47
and enemies whose gimmick was wearing thin after Gary three. I'm willing to bet most players got bored
6:52
and left before they found it. If you found this, be honest. You didn't find it because the location was so cool
6:57
it made you want to look around and see all of it. You found it because you were using a guide to find all the bobble heads. Thanks, Carl.
7:04
Eventually, players lose interest in picking through empty buildings full of locked easy safes
7:09
in case there's something interesting in them.
7:16
[cash register dings] Oh, boy! A Bottle Cap! Meanwhile, Vault 22 isn't even the coolest vault in ""New Vegas.""
7:23
Vault 11 is straight up an incredibly well-written piece of fiction and it's just hiding off in a little nook waiting for you to be sent there
7:29
as part of a quest for the Brotherhood of Steel. ""I need you to go on this important quest for me. Our air conditioner's broken.""
7:35
Yep, yep, yep. Great, great! I'm going to destroy this faction. This approach to quest design is all over the place
7:41
offering you very simple and straightforward-seeming things, and then pulling the rug out from under you. Honestly, there are probably too many.
7:47
It's at the point where if you happen to pick up enough cute little bottle caps with stars on them you stumble into a quest
7:52
to discover a legendary treasure. You get random encounters with people murdering each other over them.
7:57
After you find your first one, this guy Malcolm eventually tracks you down and tells you about the quest. He's kind of notorious for doing it
8:02
at really unexpected times. You might notice he seems to be at a weird angle looking down at me. That's because on this play through,
8:08
I was crouching preparing for a fight when he found me. [crickets chirping]
8:13
- Hello there. - It was actually kind of terrifying, but I admire his dedication. Now gimme the Caps. [bottle caps rattling]
8:18
Yeah-- Okay, I'm gonna be nice about ""Fallout 3."" There's some good stuff in there, and some of these quests are genuinely good,
8:24
like when a talking tree asks you to kill it in spite of it's existence bringing people hope, or resolving a dispute between two broken people
8:31
masquerading as comic book characters and harassing a town, or when an old woman asks you to find her the world's last remaining Stradivarius violin.
8:39
A handful of the quests in ""Fallout 3"" end up being genuinely good, funny, and even touching at times.
8:44
If anything, they annoy me in a particular way because they made me see how amazing a game would be if it was filled with quests like these.
8:51
[clears throat] ""New Vegas"" is a game filled with quests like these. But, hey, maybe it's a quality over quantity type thing.
8:57
I mean, even if you don't like the quests in ""3,"" at least there's a lot of them. Obsidian only had 18 months to make ""New Vegas,""
9:02
so there's no way they could make that many que-- [Yumiko Kanki & Ryo Nagamatsu's ""Mute City (Mario Kart 8)""]
9:07
[tape deck pausing] But hold on. To really explore what makes the game play in these quests so much more engaging, we should cover some of the more serious
9:14
core mechanical changes between these supposedly similar games, and to do that, we should go back to how in the quest
9:19
having a high science skill affects dialogue. Actually, no, we should probably go back to the beginning
9:24
of the ga--oh, let's just start again. - ♪ To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day ♪
Part Two: Died To Live
9:30
- Get it? It's like a clever reversal of the chapter in the ""Fallout 3"" vide-- ah, it doesn't matter. ""New Vegas's"" opening,
9:36
character creation process, and first area are just the best I've ever seen a game introduce itself and its core game play.
9:41
Let's take a look at some of the things it does. - ♪ Heartaches by the number ♪ - Pressing the New Game button causes the player to get shot
9:48
in the face. ""New Vegas"" seemingly goes out of its way to begin
9:53
with the logical opposite of something as cliché as the main character's birth. You're then revived by Doc Mitchell
9:59
who put you back together after a robot cowboy-- yes, I said that right. Robot cowboy. This is the best game ever--
10:05
dug them out of their shallow grave. The opening gives the player a deliberate barrage of questions. What was I shot over? Who was this guy?
10:11
What was he saying about a delivery? Why were the guys with him so differently dressed? He referred to them as ""Khans."" Who are they?
10:17
Or if you've played ""Fallout"" one and ""2,"" what are they doing here? These mysteries are a really compelling hook.
10:23
You know how a lot of players ignore the main story in open world RPGs and go do something else? That's because the story didn't interest them.
10:29
[laser fires] Going in search of Benny and the platinum chip he shot you for sounds really cool, so a lot more players are gonna want to find him.
10:35
Even the way Benny talks in, like, an old '50s Vegas style-- - But I ain't a fink, dig?
10:41
- The fact he's wearing a cool checkered suit in the post apocalypse-- all of this stuff really makes you wanna track him down
10:46
and find out what his deal is. - What in the goddamn-- - Benny and his motivations and personality are really cool to learn about.
10:52
It helps that he's voiced by Matthew Perry, too. John Gonzalez--the lead writer for ""New Vegas--"" did a really fantastic job with him,
10:58
and while I'm at it, Gonzalez is like an unsung hero in all the games he works on. Like, he co-developed the Nemesis System
11:04
For ""Shadow of Mordor."" You know, like, the best thing in that game. Actual quote from Gonzalez's LinkedIn: ""I was the lead story guy on ""Fallout: New Vegas.
11:11
Thank you, God."" [laughs] No, John. Thank you. Did I just imply that I'm God?
11:17
Players are much more likely to actively take part in a story if they have questions they actually want answering.
11:22
Also, did I mention the robot cowboy? - ♪ My ramblin' days were through ♪ ""Fallout"" one and ""2"" had the right idea
11:28
when character creation was one screen long and then the game just started right away. There you are in the world. Have fun.
11:35
Try to get further than Ed did. Granted, the character creation screen was also evidence Black Isle didn't have a UI designer.
11:41
Literally every first time ""Fallout"" player has accidentally named their first character ""None"" because they were supposed to type it into here,
11:47
but still, they were onto something here. One of my biggest gripes about ""Fallout 3"" was how long it took to start.
11:53
The opening sequence deciding your character's stats and learning the basics of the game play takes 19 years of in-game time--
11:59
and honestly, it feels that long-- before eventually your father realizes he's forgotten to do the main quest and escapes
12:04
and you go after him. It's only when you finally leave the vault that the game properly opens up to be explored.
12:10
""Fallout: New Vegas's"" opening is as smooth as butter, and not the butter you keep in the fridge. The butter your parents keep in a little dish by the table
12:16
so it's already smooth and melty when you need it, and it's just so spreadable and every time you visit them, you make a mental note to get one
12:22
but you forget again as soon as you-- after the opening cut scene, you're talking to Doc Mitchell where you make your character and then walk outside his house
12:28
and bam, the game begins. ""Fallout 2"" opens by forcing you to complete a dungeon that's pretty repetitive after
12:34
the first few times through. It's one of the few things most people don't like about ""2"" and players often use mods to skip it entirely.
12:39
Can you imagine having, like, a decade of hindsight on all the criticisms people had of ""Fallout 2"" and then making a game where the opening is, like,
12:46
three times as long? That would be a bit silly, wouldn't it? Eh, I'm sure they'll learn their lesson for ""Fallout 4.""
12:51
[disappointing music] The character creation process is really fun, too. You pick your starting stats through a really cute device
12:58
called the Vigor Tester, and then you get a psych exam which involves an honest-to-God Rorschach test
13:03
which is just great. Some players actually modded in what they saw as options. That's it. That's all it does. It lets you pick ""two bears high-fiving""
13:09
for one of the images. 22,000 downloads, including me. That's definitely two bears high-fiving.
13:15
When you get to pick your tagged skills, though, you'll notice the list of skills is a little different from ""3."" Big Guns and Small Guns are missing, for example.
13:22
There's just Guns now, but in addition to this, all these skills have much more uses than they did
13:27
in the previous games, too. - ♪ When you say I love you ♪ - Okay, look, we all love speech, right?
13:34
Kudos to the series for making a video game where talking was a skill worth putting points into at all, but a problem plaguing ""Fallout"" games since the beginning
13:41
was that one skill made you the master of half the game's main form of interaction, which really wasn't ideal.
13:47
Games have tried to section off speech into different types of speech, but let's be honest. None of them have really worked.
13:53
""New Vegas"" goes for the opposite solution. It keeps speech as is while giving other skills the chance to influence dialogue.
14:00
The game is also cleverly using its opening area--Goodsprings-- to great effect in tutorializing players about this feature.
14:06
The first real quest in the game is to prepare for an attack on the town. This quest has multiple optional components
14:12
where you can ask the townspeople for help, and each of them needs convincing using a different skill. This whole quest is basically
14:17
the game showing you how many different ways you can play it. Like, hey, if you were good at barter, you could have talked this guy into helping.
14:23
All the players who took this quest know that barter can influence dialogue and not just how much things cost,
14:28
and--minor spoilers--barter can be used to beat the final boss. I'm not even kidding. That's how many options you have here.
14:34
If you want Easy Pete to share his dynamite with you, you have to prove you wouldn't blow your head off if he did.
14:39
He doesn't need $10 words to convince him. He needs you to prove you're better at throwing explosives than these clowns.
14:45
Now that's what I call a... He blew himself u-- Checks like this for other abilities are all over the game.
14:51
Speech is still really useful, but conversations are so much more varied in what they ask of player characters, and that's great.
14:58
Medicine--a skill I ignored in every other ""Fallout"" game-- now unlocks some of the best dialogue options
15:03
because it turns out being a doctor in a post-apocalypse is really, really good at opening doors for you. What other game lets you do therapy at a cannibal chef
15:11
until he has a breakdown and quits his job? Players are more likely to fell like the type of character they made had a tangible impact
15:18
on a conversation which creates a rewarding sense of control. On top of all of this, the way dialogue actually works
15:24
has been changed significantly from ""3."" In ""3,"" if something required speech, even if you had the maximum amount of speech,
15:30
the game could still randomly decide you failed the check so you could build your character around speech and still just not get to use it.
15:37
Or you could build your character around everything else and just reload the game until you got it anyway. In ""New Vegas,"" if you had the required skill,
15:44
it works. - It just works. - It even tells you if you don't have enough and--in a choice that someone should have won an award for--
15:50
it gives you a worse line to say as a result. I really like this because it means you can pick bad options on purpose and see what happens.
15:57
It's great. Finally, I can role play as a complete loser because I'm so sick of winning in real life.
16:03
So now speech is useful based on how many points you put into it, not whether the game decides it,
16:09
which makes this character creation feel way more tangible and substantive. The points feel like they actually matter.
16:15
Right after this comes another big change from ""3."" After picking your tagged skills, you get to pick up to two traits, which, well--
16:22
[rock music] These were a really cool feature in the early ""Fallout"" games. Traits would optionally give you some kind
16:27
of interesting bonus and a downside to go with them, so you could be a one-hander so you're a bit more accurate
16:32
with one-handed weapons, but a whole lot less accurate with two-handed ones to compensate. Some of them were just mild changes
16:38
like Bloody Mess which makes every death animation always the most violent one for whatever weapon you were using. I really love Jinxed which vastly increases
16:46
the amount of critical failures-- an otherwise pretty rare occurrence-- for everyone in the game, including you. Traits led to vastly different ways
16:53
of playing the game right from the outset. They were a really cool addition to the RPG formula, everybody loved them,
16:59
and ""Fallout 3"" removed them for no reason, which was a shame because traits were the spiciest part
17:04
of character creation. They're a chance to make a character worse at something in exchange for a reward, and that's a really interesting decision to give to players.
17:12
I really like Four Eyes which reduces your perception by one, but you get it back and one more once you find a set of glasses.
17:17
Once you account for that, it's kind of like getting an extra special point, but there's also a secret downside you don't realize at first.
17:23
You can't wear glasses with power armor helmets and stuff like that, so it affects what stuff you end up wearing later in the game, too.
17:29
Plus, as a guy who needs to wear contact lenses all day or he'll fall over and die, I feel very seen by this trait.
17:34
Having that kind of control over what your character is like making them as unique as you want is kind of one of the central features
17:40
of role playing games. What sort of character the player makes is one of their main forms of expression,
17:45
and it's so nice having them back. One of the traits is Wild Wasteland which-- actually, let's give it its own-- [guitar strumming]
17:51
The ""Fallout"" games have always been a very strong mix of serious themes and ideas, desperation and survival--
17:57
- Your bones are scraped clean by the desolate wind. - But the series also has a tremendous sense of humor.
18:02
- I was in bad shape and, well, I passed out. - How did you survive? - Didn't! Got killed! [laughing]
18:09
- This is one of the most important conversations in the canon of ""Fallout."" And there's also just tons of silly shit like randomly happening upon a talking cow
18:17
or finding a TARDIS or a crashed spaceship with a picture of Elvis on an alien's corpse. - [Elvis singing]
18:22
- Wild Wasteland optionally makes things a little bit weirder. If you're serious about role playing and realism
18:28
or just hate fun, it's nice that you can avoid these things by not picking this trait, but it adds a lot of great stuff--
18:33
little references and in-jokes and comedic things-- most of which I don't want to spoil, some of which are too obscure to bother explaining,
18:39
but I love it. It's also really clever to make it a choice so everyone gets the experience they prefer.
18:44
Half of this stuff is so weird, it makes sense it's optional. Not everyone wants to reenact a ""Monty Python"" sketch
18:49
in the middle of some post-apocalyptic scavenging. Am I getting mugged by three old ladies? Oh, Veronica, no!
18:55
Wild Wasteland even references that mod I mentioned earlier in the game's DLC. I love this game.
19:01
Anyway, during the early questing and prepping for the attack on the town, you're going to level up and get to choose your first perk,
19:06
and by the way.... [surfer rock music] In his GDC retrospective on the first ""Fallout,""
19:12
original creator Tim Cane talks about the impact of perks on play testing. - Uh, QA loved that they could make characters
19:17
that were different than the-- the guy sitting right next to him in QA and they could play the game very differently because of it. - Here's a game design term for you:
19:23
horizontal progression. Vertical progression is when the numbers get higher, and, yeah, sure, numbers going up can be fun
19:29
and pleasing in its own way, but giving someone a new power-- a new thing they can do-- is usually way more rewarding.
19:35
They actually came up with perks to give players more to do when they level up. - Brian Fargo took the game home, played it for a weekend, came back and said,
19:41
""I love it except when I go up a level, skill points aren't enough for me to do."" - In other words, according to ""Fallout's"" original creator,
19:48
perks exist in order to make leveling up feel more substantive than just putting points into stats.
19:53
Pause for effect. A lot of the perks in ""Fallout 3"" just add more points into stats, so you level up, you assign your points,
19:59
and then, oh, I guess I can put five more points into Science and Medicine. Or I can put five points in Small Guns and Repair.
20:06
Or I can put 15 points into Big Guns That almost makes Big Guns a feasible skill
20:12
that doesn't need deleting from the ga-- Do you like when the numbers get higher? I hope you do. Could I have a more interesting form
20:17
of progression, please? [gun fires] I mean, let's be fair. There are some good perks like Animal Friend. So certain animals--even the really dangerous ones--
20:24
will just hang out with you now, or even defend you in battle if you take it twice, which is cool. Black Widow and Lady Killer are pretty nice, too.
20:30
It's certainly better than having five more Sneak and Lock Pick come on. First off, literally all of the boring perks
20:36
have been deliberately removed from ""New Vegas."" Like, there were so many and they're all gone.
20:41
[booming] It's like you can tell someone who knows what they're doing looked at ""3's"" perks and said, ""These ones are bad. Take them out.""
20:47
But here's the thing, right? ""New Vegas"" gets to make its perks way more interesting and cool because they've changed
20:53
the way they're used in the game. In ""New Vegas,"" perks have more demanding requirements
20:58
before you can take them. Meltdown is a ridiculously cool perk that causes enemies killed with energy weapons
21:04
to explode in a burst of damage which can often cause massive chain reactions.
21:10
Okay, that's a bit much, to be honest. This perk is hella horizontal. Hella. What a great word.
21:15
It makes specializing in energy weapons feel amazing. You're blowing people up left and right. It's great but you can only get this cool,
21:21
overpowered power--that's-- [stammers] if you have 90 Energy Weapon skill which is a really steep requirement,
21:27
especially considering ""New Vegas"" gives you a lot fewer skill points per level and you only get to pick a perk once every two levels now,
21:34
which is how it was in the original games, too. That's another thing ""3"" changed for some reason. Cool perks are a reward
21:39
for how you built your character. Players are incentivized to plan ahead and think about what sort of character they want to make
21:45
and what perks they want to end up with which is intensely engaging. Only one perk in three requires a skill as high as 80
21:52
and most have no skill requirements at all. There's a very real sense of progress to building up
21:57
a character in ""New Vegas"" because perks add genuinely unique things. Also, this is a small thing, but in ""Fallout 3,""
22:03
there was a perk that let you get some more romantic dialogue with characters of the opposite gender so you could play a womanizing man
22:09
or a mananizing woman. It also let you deal 10% more damage to that gender for some reason.
22:14
I'm sure it was unintentional, but the existence of these perks implies Bethesda don't think
22:19
gay people exist in the ""Fallout"" universe, which is quite funny. ""New Vegas"" added a same gender version of the perk
22:25
so you could play as a gay character, or you could take both which at that point gave you a 10% damage bonus against almost everyone
22:31
and was also a really nice piece of representation. You were at that point role playing a bisexual character in a video game in 2010,
22:39
which was super cool. I should have led with that and not the damage bonus. - ♪ I'm going under ♪
22:46
- Back in the days of ""Fallout 3,"" people loved modding in more severe survival elements. ""Fallout Wanderers Edition"" is the most downloaded mod
22:53
for ""3"" by a pretty wide margin and it's a great mod. It makes the game much more engaging and challenging.
22:58
It also came with a built-in alternative start option so you didn't fucking have to do the vault again. ""New Vegas"" gives new player who like that sort of thing
23:05
an option built into the game. On your way out at the front door, you're given the choice to use Hardcore Mode.
23:10
It makes Stimpacks heal over time so you can't pause the game and get all your health back in the middle of a fight. You have to manage thirst,
23:16
hunger, and sleep now. Companions can die, which is terrifying. Veronica, no! And even bullets affect your carry weight now.
23:22
It really isn't messing around, either. In the middle of a normal play through, I tried turning it on and suddenly I was at three times my maximum carrying capacity.
23:30
I had to drop all this stuff just to be able to move. Don't look at me like that, Veronica. It's not littering anymore. The world's ended.
23:36
This little extra optional realism adds a lot to the experience for people who like that sort of thing.
23:42
I'm personally a really big fan of when developers add things into games because they know
23:47
that people would want them there and mod them in if they weren't. Like, people also modded iron sights into ""Fallout 3"" a lot.
23:53
""Fallout 3"" didn't have iron sights for some reason. It just zoomed in a bit.
24:01
But guess what? ""New Vegas"" has iron sights now. It's great. In fact, this actually reveals another problem with ""Fallout 3's"" design.
24:06
You can't aim down the sights of certain guns that were made for ""Fallout 3"" because whoever designed them at the time forgot to put sights on them.
24:14
Like, they didn't think about how a person would use them. Look at the laser pistol, for example. There's just, like, a nub and a little rail there.
24:20
What am I looking down? Here's the laser rifle. It's a pretty nice-looking gun, but it wasn't built with consideration
24:25
for how a person would actually use it. In third person, when you right-click, the character does an aim down sights animation,
24:31
but there's no sights there. What is she doing? Bethesda noticed this, too, because they redesigned laser weapons in ""4""
24:36
to have sights on them. Another thing people frequently modded into ""Fallout 3"" was the ability to upgrade and modify weapons.
24:42
That's a bit of a confusing concept. Modding in weapon mods? The base game in ""New Vegas"" comes with the ability
24:47
to modify weapons. Now you can upgrade and customize your equipment. It's great. Hilariously, one of the mods
24:52
for the laser weapons is working iron sights. This is the weapon upgrade version of a subtweet.
24:58
Combine that with the fact there's way, way more weapons in ""New Vegas"" and different ammo types for the weapons, too,
25:03
and all of a sudden you have so much more room for choice in how you build your character and what weapons you use. [booming] Optimized ammo, baby!
25:11
Okay, I got distracted there and talked about a bunch of other stuff, but that's because ""New Vegas"" is so good at tying everything together.
25:17
The opening quest at Goodsprings is a really well-designed introduction to the ways the character you've built
25:22
and your skills and traits and perks can be used as you prep for the town's big battle, and the final ","(Spoilers for New Vegas, obviously)

0:05
""And action!""
0:06
Being an artist myself
0:08
It comes as no surprise that
0:10
Some of my favourite films happen to be about making art
0:13
Since these movies are all made by artists
0:17
Their representations are often quite accurate
0:20
""Two word review, just says...""
0:22
""Sh*t sandwich""
0:24
And as an audience member
0:26
Knowing the subject matter intimately
0:28
Helps make these films even more enjoyable
0:32
Studio Ghibli's underrated gem
0:34
Whisper of the Heart
0:35
Is no exception
0:36
A slice of life film about the life of a young teen writer
0:40
It is one of the most comfortable film Ghibli has ever made
0:44
But my experience with the film
0:46
Is somewhat different
0:48
I happened to watch this film on TV
0:50
When I was still a pre-teen
0:52
Before I discovered my passion for art and writing
0:57
It was such a great viewing experience
0:59
I still vividly remember the details
1:03
When I returned to this film many years later as an artist in training
1:07
My understanding of the film had changed
1:09
And I found myself relate to this film
1:11
In a much more emotional way
1:14
So in this video
1:15
We won't be doing the usual analysis and cultural study
1:19
I just want to share my personal experience
1:22
Of being an artist
1:23
And how the film parallels the journey of an artist
1:27
Let me show you
1:28
What I see
1:29
When I watch Whisper of the Heart
Whisper of the Heart
1:41
Before we begin
1:42
I strongly recommend giving this film a watch
1:45
There will be heavy spoilers in this essay
1:47
And as with almost all Ghibli films
1:50
It is worth it to jump into it with no set expectations
1:54
Whisper of the Heart is a simple girl meets boy story
1:58
Our protagonist, Shizuku, is a middle school student
2:01
With a fondness for fiction books
2:03
And a natural talent for writing poetries and lyrics
2:07
""Country road...""
2:10
""Leading far away...""
2:12
One day, following a cat
2:14
She stumbles upon an antique shop
2:16
Where she meets Tim from the YouTube Channel Grand Illusions
2:20
And his grandson, Seiji
2:22
Young Seiji has a dream of becoming a violin maker
2:26
And is about to head to Italy for two months to study the craft
2:30
Enamored by him and his aspiration
2:32
Shizuku decides to find her own purpose in life as well
2:37
She decides to spend the two month Seiji is away
2:40
Writing a novel of her own
2:41
""He's going to find out if he has talent""
2:44
""Well, so will I""
2:48
""I'll write a story!""
2:51
In film, for dramatic effect
2:53
The featured artist tends to exhibit this unrelenting passion
2:57
A romanticized obsession about a certain dream
3:01
Becoming a great filmmaker, for example
3:04
That is a notion that
3:06
I don't find particularly...
3:08
Healthy
3:09
I much prefer the story of Vincent van Gogh
3:12
As told through the film
3:13
Lust for Life
3:15
Where van Gogh does painting
3:17
Because that's just something he does
3:20
All the working artists I know of
3:22
Are similar
3:23
It is much less about grand passion and dreams
3:27
And more so ""It's just something I do""
3:30
It would be nice if we make it big one day
3:33
But even when it costs us so much time and money
3:36
We keep doing it
3:37
Because...
3:38
It is part of our identity
3:41
We see this in Shizuku, too
3:43
She doesn't have this grand dream of becoming a great writer
3:47
""There's one I want to write""
3:48
""If he can do it, so can I""
3:50
It is as simple as something she decides one day
3:54
That she wants to give it a shot
3:56
The starting motivation can be as simple
3:58
As wanting to better yourself for the one you love
4:01
Or in my case
4:02
Having a great teacher who encouraged me
4:06
Miss Luo, if you are listening
4:07
Thanks
4:09
There is rarely a grand destiny call
4:11
It's often just a plain decision
4:14
Put it another way
4:16
An attempt to be an artist
4:17
Is less about pursuing a dream
4:19
And more so about proving you are
4:21
Who you think you are
4:23
Shizuku didn't choose to be a writer
4:25
Because she has a passion for it
4:27
""You've got a talent for poetry""
4:29
""You have talent""
4:31
People tell her she has talent for it
4:33
Like a gem hidden inside a stone
4:36
And she wants to go out and prove to herself
4:38
That she can do it
4:40
""I'm scared. What if there isn't a beautiful crystal in me""
4:45
""But I want to write. And you'll be the first one to see it""
4:48
And if you are still confused
4:50
Just know that
4:51
Even when the world ends
4:53
Even when an artist is the last person on Earth
4:57
When no one else is there to give their work recognition
5:00
The artist will still be crafting art
5:03
It's just something we do
Self Doubt
5:10
Back to the film
5:11
Shizuku decides to write a fantasy story
5:14
Where she needs to find a magical gemstone
5:17
Under time pressure
5:19
She struggles to find it
5:20
And all she got was...
5:22
A dead baby bird
5:27
What I find especially good about Whisper of the Heart
5:30
Is its depiction of the difficulty in being an artist
5:34
""It's not easy when you walk your own road""
5:37
""You've only got yourself to blame""
5:41
For example, self-doubt
5:43
You can make a drinking game out of this
5:46
Take a shot every time
5:47
Shizuku says her work is not good
5:50
""That's not bad.""
5:51
""Yes it is""
5:53
""It's trite""
5:54
Self-doubt comes with the territory
5:56
Knowing that art is something innate
5:59
Realizing we don't have the talent we thought we have
6:02
Is to realize we are not the person we thought we are
6:05
It is scary
6:07
Shizuku's story is a clear metaphor for discovering her own talent
6:11
The beautiful crystal she talked about
6:14
And her fear that
6:15
She has none in her
6:17
It's a constant vicious cycle
6:20
Your art will never be good enough for you
6:23
After all
6:24
If they are
6:25
You stopped improving
6:27
But this obsession with talent is a trap
6:30
A topic that Whisper of the Heart addresses
6:33
A thing that I missed as a casual audience
6:36
But resonated with me after I went to film school
6:39
""There's lots as good as me""
6:41
Talent can only bring you to page 5
6:44
""Say what you really think!""
6:45
""I couldn't write what I wanted""
6:48
""The last half doesn't make sense""
6:49
""I know that""
6:51
The rest
6:51
Is all hard work
6:54
Years of it
6:55
Upon deciding to write her book
6:57
Her reading list expands from only fiction
7:00
To Non-fiction and documents
7:03
She is almost always constantly working
7:05
Scene after scene
7:07
Every word on the page is grinded into shape
7:11
It is something that
7:12
Non-artists don't realized
7:15
""You were up until 4 again?!""
7:16
Or, at least, don't pay attention to
7:19
No one is born naturally talented
7:22
Not in ways our society perceives
7:24
Even prodigies need a lot of practice
7:27
It's why we have school for art
7:30
The film explains it better than I ever could
7:33
""The rough stone is inside you. You have to find it and then polish it""
7:38
""It takes time and effort""
7:41
It takes time and effort
7:44
When this journey begins
7:45
We think we are a talented artist
7:48
But as we journey forth
7:49
We will inevitably realize
7:52
We have a long way to go
7:53
""Anyone can do that""
7:57
""I've got a long way to go""
8:00
The only way to be who we want to be
8:02
Is to put in the work
8:04
And become who we want to be
The Climax
8:24
Depression is almost inevitable
8:26
In the creation of art
8:28
There is almost no way
8:30
Your art turns out better than you can hope
8:32
Yet despite endless self-doubt
8:34
We crave for feedback and resolution
8:38
Even if we expect the worst
8:40
Even if we know many out there will judge us harshly
8:44
Trust me, you can't judge me harsher than I do
8:48
At the end
8:49
Shizuku hands her finished novel to Tim
8:52
Her first reader
8:54
There is not a shred of excitement on her face
8:58
Finishing an art piece
8:59
Is like making a call into the void
9:02
What awaits you is often not excitement
9:05
But anxiety
9:07
The climax of the film is just a series of shots
9:11
No music
9:13
Instead of the world feeling alive
9:15
Like the opening scene
9:16
Where people moving about
9:19
Now
9:19
The world sits still
9:22
Holding its breath
9:23
The only things moving are machines
9:26
Time passing slowly, quietly
9:29
Awaiting for an answer
9:32
For most people
9:33
This climax is calm and mellow
9:36
But for an artist
9:38
It is suffocating
9:40
When the answer comes
9:42
The self-doubt continues
9:44
""Thank you. It's very good""
9:47
""It's not. It's not!""
9:48
And when the dust settles
9:50
When reality sinks in
9:53
When you can finally cry
9:55
It is the most cathartic feeling
10:01
We have journeyed far
10:03
To discover our true self
10:05
Usually realizing that
10:06
We don't have nearly as much talent as we thought we have
10:11
The road seems endless
10:13
Because it really is
10:15
You will never be better than you want to be
10:18
But when you are rested
10:20
But when you are ready to do it all over
10:23
Next time, looking back
10:25
You'll realize
10:26
How far you've come
10:32
At this point in the video
10:34
The essay part is over
10:36
But I do have something related I want to talk about
10:39
Specifically, director Yoshifumi Kondo
10:43
A hardworking artist himself
10:45
Right after finishing this film
10:47
He immediately moved on to work on Princess Mononoke
10:51
A decision that Hayao Miyazaki would regret immensely
10:56
Not long after the release of Princess Mononoke
10:59
Yoshifumi Kondo passed away from an aneurysm
11:02
Said to have brought on by overwork
11:05
He was just 47 years old at the time
11:09
It is commonly believed that his death is the main reason
11:13
For Miyazaki's first retirement
11:15
Considering that Kondo was supposed to be
11:18
Miyazaki's successor
11:19
I can see why
11:21
For this reason
11:22
I don't want to glorify the what has happened
11:25
It is an absolute preventable tragedy
11:28
The animation industry in Japan has been
11:31
And still is notoriously labor intensive
11:34
A problem that the people of Japan is currently trying to solve
11:39
But a part of me does understand
11:42
I took a history of animation course in film school
11:45
During a Studio Ghibli focused class
11:48
Our professor said
11:50
""Miyazaki said he is retired""
11:52
""We'll see about that""
11:54
Well, that sure didn't take long
11:57
We know, because that's who we are
11:59
Artists
12:00
People who know we shouldn't
12:02
And don't really want to overwork
12:04
But given the opportunity
12:06
We WILL work ourselves to death
12:08
If no one is there to stop us
12:11
I find artists don't often talk about their creative process openly
12:16
Especially not among our peers
12:18
Even artists are no immune
12:20
To wanting to preserve the mystic of appearing talented
12:25
But, to all the artists out there
12:27
If you are listening
12:29
I got you
12:30
I know that feeling
12:32
The sudden drive to create something
12:34
The self-doubt
12:36
The anxiety
12:37
The depression
12:39
The compulsion
12:40
And the catharsis you feel when the work is done
12:44
But, please, remember to take breaks
12:47
There really is no reason for Shizuku to self-impose
12:50
Her two month deadline
12:53
Should you feel tired
12:54
Don't be afraid to stop
12:56
Miyazaki takes 6 month breaks between projects
13:00
You aren't procrastinating
13:02
You are just tired
13:04
When you are well rested
13:06
When an idea comes to you
13:08
When your heart whispers to you once more
13:10
Journey on
13:12
Safely","Accented Cinema - Episode 37

This is a bit of a different episode. It is a personal take on a film that, with time, becoming more and more personal to me. Being an artist is a lot more emotionally challenging than many people know. It is a lot of hard work that, as a society, we often overlooked.

In this video, I'd like to share with you, my personal feelings of being an artist, and share with you, what I see when I watched Whisper of the Heart.

Your Island is a Commune pt. 1 | Nowhere Grotesk,"87,724","7,300",1/11/20,22:31,"0:00
I've never engaged with the game the way  I do with Animal Crossing: New Horizons.  
0:04
Most days I spend at least an hour running around  my island, digging up fossils, watering flowers,  
0:09
and greeting my villagers and gifting them things.  I'll return in the evening to check for shooting  
0:14
stars or see if Celeste or Wisp is wandering  around. This routine puts me at ease, and at least  
0:20
for a few minutes out of the day I get a chance to  take a deep breath and remember that I'm capable  
0:24
of feeling like a human. Which is kind of weird,  considering I'm talking to a bunch of virtual  
0:30
animals who call me ""scooter."" New Horizons is  on track to become the best-selling game for the  
0:36
Switch. I see a lot of its success attributed  to the game offering escapism during lockdown,  
0:41
or providing a routine while we're all stuck at  home. And yeah, this probably has affected its  
0:46
popularity, but it's unfair to dismiss the game  based on global events that Nintendo couldn't  
0:51
have predicted when they started development. New  Horizons was always going to be a massive success,  
0:55
because the Animal Crossing series has been  popular from its very start. Each game in the  
0:59
series differs from the last in big and small  ways, but all of them are deeply rooted in  
1:03
communication, compassion, and village life. And  you really couldn't ask for a better setting than  
1:08
the village for a game like this. It's small  enough to feel intimate, yet large enough to  
1:13
give you a sense of freedom and independence. And  despite the ever-present in-game clock, the series  
1:17
is mostly divorced from the present, taking  place in an expressly fictional village that  
1:21
has no real time or place. This isn't just a game  feature, it's a Japanese concept called furusato.  
1:27
You're probably already familiar with the way  furusato looks thanks to Japanese media exports:  
1:32
Rurouni Kenshin, Inuyasha, Mushi-shi, Okami, even  Ocarina of Time. One could argue that Pokémon even  
1:39
builds on furusato tropes, though some of the  most easily recognizable examples would be the  
1:44
animated films of Miyazaki Hayao and Studio  Ghibli, with their worlds of lush villages,  
1:49
old shrines, and pastoral landscapes in tension  with urban life and modern Japan. Furusato  
1:54
functions as a shorthand for cultural nostalgia  connected to village life that no longer exists,  
2:00
often represented as an ""idyllic  non-existent countryside home,  
2:04
a far away place in the past."" Up until recently,  Japan consisted mostly of villages, but after  
2:10
rapid industrialization brought on by western  influence in the late 1800s, these villages began  
2:16
to empty or disappear entirely. Fast forward  to the 1980s, and 90 percent of the population  
2:21
is living in cities, and the post-war economic  boom Japan had been experiencing had stalled out.  
2:27
Attempting to inspire national pride and  confidence, and distract from bad economic  
2:31
conditions, the Japanese government dusts  off for furusato and reminds everyone of  
2:35
this idealized Japan. They ran ad campaigns that  focused on getting city folk to hop on a train  
2:41
and rediscover their home in rural villages.  Wait a second - that sounds kind of familiar.  
2:48
The only thing that's missing is a sweatered blue  cat asking you questions as you ride your unknown  
2:53
destination... If you're familiar with Animal  Crossing, furusato is likely recognizable to you:  
2:58
""furusato literally means 'old village,' but  its closer English equivalents are 'home' and  
3:03
'native place.' As a landscape, the quintessential  features of furusato include forested mountains,  
3:08
fields cut by a meandering river, and a cluster of  thatch-roofed farmhouses."" For anyone that isn't  
Furusato & Community
3:16
familiar, Animal Crossing is what's referred to as  a ""social simulator."" Each of the main title games  
3:21
begin with the player character arriving in their  new home a village populated by anthropomorphic  
3:26
animals. In-game activities include fishing,  catching bugs, and socializing with the villagers.
3:36
The in-game clock simulates real time, which  affects which fish and bugs you can catch,  
3:42
if shops are open or closed, and even what color  the landscape is as seasons change. The only  
3:47
real objective the game gives you is to pay off  your interest-free mortgage, however, like most  
3:53
things in the game this is completely optional.  While the games all have a definitive beginning,  
3:58
there is no middle or end. They are entirely  player driven, and you have no goals except for  
4:03
the ones that you set for yourself. They're all  about freedom, and what you decide to do with it.  
4:09
The first game in the series, Dōbutsu no  Mori or ""Animal Forest,"" released in 2001.  
4:14
It was a Japanese exclusive and Nintendo's last  first party release for the N64. It was initially  
4:20
planned for the 64DD, which was a peripheral for  the N64, but the DD failed at market. Originally  
4:26
intended to be a much larger game, with a bigger  scope that featured a more goal-oriented player  
4:30
experience, without the extra processing power of  the DD it had to be slimmed down considerably to  
4:35
run on the N64. Instead of the player needing  the help of animal villagers to dungeon crawl,  
4:40
beat bosses, and complete a storyline, it became  the Animal Crossing experience we know today:  
4:46
an open-ended life sim with no real goals  that relied on small, yet meaningful tasks to  
4:51
provide player satisfaction. Dōbutsu no Mori was  never intended to be released outside of Japan.  
4:56
Hallmarks of Japanese villages were prominently  featured: small mail offices, Shinto-inspired  
5:02
shrines, morning group calisthenics, even starting  the game with a train ride out to the countryside  
5:08
which mirrored the furusato ad campaigns run by  the government. But Nintendo of America pushed  
5:13
to do a localization, and the translated version  became Animal Crossing: Population Growing, which  
5:18
released in September 2002. For the localization,  the village was reworked to be less Japanese:  
5:24
bell shrines became wishing wells, tofu was  replaced with chowder, Japanese festivals  
5:29
were swapped out for international ones,  and if anything was too Japanese to convert  
5:34
it was dropped altogether. And even after  removing its explicitly Japanese elements,  
5:39
the game still is deeply rooted in furusato.  To understand why, we have to go back to the  
5:44
very start. The story of Animal Crossing begins in  1986, when a young game dev named Eguchi Katsuya  
5:50
moved from his home in Chiba to Kyoto to start  working for Nintendo. After cutting his teeth  
5:54
on some of Nintendo's major releases for the N64  in the 90s, he was given the freedom to direct  
5:59
his own original title. He used this opportunity  to make a game about community and connection,  
6:05
inspired by the intense loneliness he had  experienced after moving away from his home  
6:09
and leaving his family and friends behind.  Eguchi certainly wasn't alone in these feelings:  
6:14
throughout Japan, people had been feeling a  loss of community. As mentioned earlier, Japan's  
6:19
post-war economic boom stalled out in the 80s,  and then things got worse. The economy collapsed  
6:25
in 1991 and remained stagnant, turning the 90s  into what's referred to as the ""lost decade.""  
6:31
Many argue that since the economy never recovered,  this lost decade never really ended. It kept going  
6:37
into the 2000s as the Animal Crossing series  really started to take off. And now that the  
6:42
Japanese people were overwhelmingly living in  cities and going through this recession separated  
6:46
from friends and family and home, it makes sense  they'd be looking for support and connection.  
6:52
Furusato is much more than an aesthetic, and this  longing for community is central to it. In 1984,  
6:59
the Asahi Shinbun, a leading national paper, asked  readers to write in with what furusato meant to  
7:04
them. One of the people who wrote, in a woman and  homemaker, described furusato as ""when and if a  
7:10
kernel of confidence, trust, and dependency  grows between you and your new neighbors,  
7:14
then new furusato is born."" Or as a civil servant  put it, ""furusato should be a place where one can  
7:20
return whenever the urge strikes, and ideally  is a place where one's kokoro finds repose  
7:25
and where daily life routines are grounded  in compassion."" The basis for Animal Crossing  
7:30
is just: that daily life routines grounded in  compassion, little worlds that you can return  
7:35
to at any time for as long as you like. Eguchi had  created virtual furusato. Since Dōbutsu no Mori,  
7:41
each game in the Animal Crossing series has  continued to evolve and expand the relationship  
7:45
between the player and their village community.  Wild World was released for the DS in 2005 or  
7:51
2006, depending on where you are in the world, and  the game was even more popular than the previous  
7:55
titles. It firmly established the mechanics  of Animal Crossing while also cementing its  
8:00
global popularity. Wild World was popular in ways  Population Growing never had the chance to be,  
8:06
and began to demonstrate how appealing furusato  could be around the globe. It was followed by  
8:10
Animal Crossing: City Folk in 2008, which was  released for the Nintendo Wii and is an outlier  
8:16
in the series. Its reviews left something to be  desired, with a common criticism being that the  
8:21
game felt lazy and that it looked like Wild World  but widescreen. And then there's the city aspect:  
8:27
instead of spending their time entirely focused  on the village, players traveled to and from the  
8:31
city to shop, quietly pivoting away from the  quaint village life where you built solidarity  
8:36
with your neighbors to a simulation of living in  a suburb. Which I'm sure might be novel for some,  
8:41
but speaking from experience, it's not the most  inspiring premise. The game ends up being at  
8:47
odds with itself, distracting players with the  bright lights of the city instead of sticking to  
8:51
building community, which is the core of every  other Animal Crossing game. So despite being  
8:57
aesthetically charming and fun for newcomers,  the game is the least popular in the series and  
9:02
the worst received of the main title games.  2012 saw the release of New Leaf for the 3DS.  
9:08
The most notable change for this game was that the  player was made mayor, and had a greater sense of  
9:12
responsibility for the community through public  works projects and ordinances. Additionally,  
9:18
the city features from City Folk were entirely  reworked so that instead of traveling away from  
9:22
your village, as it expands the conveniences that  were in the city become integrated into the town  
9:28
instead. New Horizons is the latest entry into  the series, having come out in March 2020. The  
9:33
game has already proven to be wildly popular, and  provides a familiar yet distinct Animal Crossing  
9:38
experience, notably departing from the previous  titles by relocating to a deserted island where  
9:43
the player builds the village from the ground up.  Similar to how New Leaf made the player mayor,  
9:48
New Horizons making the player the resident rep  allows for a deeper connection to the village.  
9:53
With this new responsibility, the player is  entrusted with bringing their new community  
9:57
together, and by starting from scratch there is an  opportunity to shape the village in ways previous  
10:03
games never allowed. New Horizons also gives the  player the most control they've ever had in the  
10:07
series: terraforming, outdoor decorating, and  easily customizable physical appearance are just  
10:12
a few ways in which the player can directly change  things. And these features exist to help you set  
10:18
the stage for your community to happen. For all  the control these features give over the island,  
10:22
ultimately it's to provide a space for players  and villagers to freely live out their lives.  
10:28
Even the modest story that the game provides  as you progress to the earliest stages  
10:32
focuses on this idea providing an excellent home  for the island's new residents and visitors.  
Community & Politics
10:39
This new approach has led journalists to call  New Horizons a ""quiet revolution"" and a game that  
10:44
""asks players what makes a society."" And while  Animal Crossing probably isn't the first series  
10:49
you'd think of when talking about politics and  gaming, these statements are politically charged.  
10:54
Eguchi wanted to make a game to fill in for the  lack of community he was experiencing in modern  
10:58
day, urbanized Japan, which ended up striking  a chord not only with other Japanese people,  
11:03
but with people all around the world.  Politics is the process of shaping our  
11:06
society and how we live, and in that way Animal  Crossing really is an exercise in politics.  
11:11
It gives us a viable interactive alternative to  how we live today. Furusato provides a place to  
11:17
start when it comes to politics that are rooted in  a sense of community. The word itself only became  
11:22
about community because of politics. The shift  in definition from literal hometown to general  
11:27
nostalgia for village life and community occurred  during the decades following the Meiji Restoration  
11:32
in 1868. In short, the restoration put the emperor  back in power and began to make Japan much more  
11:38
""western."" The feudal government was replaced  with one modeled after european countries,  
11:44
and a capitalist economy began to be forced on  the nation, replacing the feudal one. While the  
11:48
outside world had spent centuries moving to the  city and forgetting village life, Japan did it in  
11:53
just a few short decades. By the 1920s, around 50%  of workers were living in cities, whereas just a  
11:59
generation prior, 90% of the population was still  living in villages. And as urban centers expanded,  
12:05
villages shrank or disappeared altogether.  By the time World War II was over, there was  
12:10
an overwhelming sense that postwar Japan could no  longer ""go home"" thanks to the rapid urbanization  
12:15
that gutted village life. The once literal term of  furusato became imbued with a much deeper meaning  
12:21
as a result of this cultural memory that lived on.  While furusato itself is generally seen as a kind  
12:27
of apolitical cultural phenomenon, as its meaning  began to change after the Meiji Restoration,  
12:32
so did the politics within Japan. The new  capitalist economy massively reshaped society:  
12:38
workers were forced into wage labor, made to toil  in factories under miserable conditions. Families  
12:43
were thrown into debt and land they had lived on  for generations became the property of landlords.  
12:48
Forced to sell their crops to pay rent, only  to later have to buy back their own food,  
12:53
villages rapidly became poor. In response to  these new oppressions, a Japanese left formed.  
12:58
And in particular, Japan's anarchist movement  would take an intense interest in the village.  
13:03
Kōtoku Shūsui, who was a social democrat at the  time, traveled to the united states in 1905,  
13:09
where he was introduced to the works of Russian  anarchists Mikhail Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin.  
13:14
After returning to Japan, Kōtoku translated  Kropotkin's book The Conquest of Bread into  
13:18
Japanese, releasing it in 1909. The translation  quickly gained popularity with the new Japanese  
13:24
anarchist movement that Kōtoku was now leading.  While it covers a variety of things, one of the  
13:28
key points that the Conquest of Bread presents  is a vision of decentralized communes, where  
13:34
people work together for everyone's benefit. For  Kōtoku and his comrades, this wasn't just an idea,  
13:39
it was a reality they could see out their  window. They pointed to the farming and fishing  
13:43
villages and how people who lived in them, the  majority of the Japanese population at the time,  
13:49
had to work together to maintain their way of  life. It was easy to build their new politics  
13:53
around these ideas. As an example of its  influence, just a year after releasing the  
13:58
translation, fellow anarchist Akaba Hajime  would write a pamphlet called ""The Peasant's  
14:02
Gospel,"" calling for the Japanese people to  ""return to the village community of long ago,  
14:07
which our remote ancestors enjoyed. We must  construct a free paradise of anarchist communism,  
14:13
which will flesh out the bones of the village  community with the most advanced scientific  
14:17
understanding and with the lofty morality  of mutual aid."" This interest in the village  
14:22
would stay consistent throughout the following  generations. Itō Noe, a feminist author and  
14:26
prominent figure in the second generation of  Japanese anarchists, wrote an article called  
14:31
""The Facts of Anarchy"" about her native village.  ""We have often heard the abuse that the ideal of  
14:37
anarchist communism is an unrealizable fancy,  yet I have found that it is not a dream,  
14:43
but something aspects of which have been realized  in the autonomy of the villages inherited from  
14:47
our ancestors... Now I want to depict the facts  that I have seen personally at my native village.  
14:53
There are no chains of command or officials. The  spirit of the associations inherited from their  
14:59
ancestors is to 'assist each other in times of  trouble.'... Egoistic urban life is intolerable  
15:05
to those accustomed to village life. Where there  is no hope of success besides poverty, it is far  
15:11
more comfortable and warm to support each other  under the protections of the association.""  
15:16
Although it might not seem relevant, there  is actually a lot of overlap with furusato:  
15:20
""Furi signifies the patina of familiarity and  naturalness that objects and human relationships  
15:25
acquire with age, use, and interaction. Sato  also refers to self-governed autonomous areas,  
15:32
and by extension, to local autonomy."" So  furusato is tied to autonomy and community,  
15:37
to human interaction on the local level. But  previous generations of Japanese anarchists  
15:43
were importing European models, while the third  generation sought to find out what anarchism meant  
15:48
to Japan, and what Japan could mean to anarchism.  Hatta Shūzō was now the leading theoretician in  
15:54
the third generation, working on the idea of ""pure  anarchism."" He was inspired by the European texts,  
16:00
but wanted to build on their ideas to make them  distinctly Japanese. This is the first time the  
16:06
Japanese anarchists sat down and really committed  themselves to developing theory of their own,  
16:10
and an understanding of what Japanese  anarchism is. And to the pure anarchists,  
16:15
this meant looking to the village, where they  saw healthy natural anarchism happening. This  
16:20
is one of their contributions to anarchist theory:  the idea that society is like a living being, and  
16:25
capitalism is a kind of sickness afflicting it. It  eats away at the sense of community and solidarity  
16:31
that all humans need and enjoy, and they saw  restoring the healthy anarchism of the village  
16:36
as a necessity - but not by going backwards.  Instead they looked to dissolve the city  
16:41
back into the village. They recognized that the  conveniences of modern life are still valuable,  
16:47
and by distributing the technology, trades, and  skills back into the village, they could both  
16:52
end the destruction being caused by urbanization  and transform the village into something better:  
16:57
the commune. Like Akaba's pamphlet, they sought  to combine advanced science and technology with  
17:03
the morality of village life. And honestly,  this isn't that far off from what we saw with  
17:08
City Folk and New Leaf. After the poor reviews  for City Folk, to restore the sense of community  
17:13
essential to furusato and the series, in New Leaf  the city features were brought back into the town,  
17:19
reintegrated as the ""main street"" that comes  to life as the player builds and expands the  
17:24
town community. And while the main street does  make the town less rural, it represents one of  
17:29
the ways in which furusato is defined. ""Furusato  is not limited to an actual rural place, nor does  
17:35
it presuppose an agricultural lifestyle. It is,  rather, everything the suburbs and metropoles are  
17:42
not. Compassion, camaraderie, tradition, and  even motherly love are presumed absent from a  
17:47
post-war urbanized society."" Unfortunately, even  though the anarchists recognized that the Japanese  
17:53
nation-state was preparing for a second world  war as early as 1927, they couldn't halt its  
17:58
march towards fascism. And as it began to invade  and colonize China and Korea in the early 1930s,  
18:05
there was intense suppression of the left that  effectively ended the anarchist movement. But  
18:10
their ideas would live on, both inside and outside  Japan. The 1970s and 80s saw furusato revived not  
18:17
just by the Japanese government, as we discussed  earlier, but by environmentalist groups in Japan,  
18:22
who saw local autonomy as a way to fight  back against pollution and urbanization.  
18:26
At the same time, anarchism found new life in  the green anarchists, or eco-anarchist movement,  
18:32
with American philosopher Murray Bookchin as a  notable pioneer. Like the Japanese anarchists in  
18:38
the first half of the century, Bookchin would look  to decentralized communes as a way to rebuild a  
18:42
healthy society, and halt the cancerous spread of  urbanization. Bookchin would write extensively on  
18:48
the ways that capitalism and the industrialization  and urbanization which it creates negatively  
18:53
affects society and humanity as a whole. By  exploring the historic European village and  
18:58
American town as places where anarchism had  organic roots, his writings echoed the pure  
19:03
anarchists in their analysis of how community  could be found again and restored - should we  
19:08
choose to. And while furusato and the theory  of the Japanese anarchists ran parallel,  
19:13
through Bookchin's work this gap is bridged.  ""Capitalism in its characteristically modern  
19:18
and dominant form threatens not only  to undermine every natural economy,  
19:23
be it small-scale agriculture, artisanship, simple  exchange relationships and the like, it threatens  
19:29
to undermine every dimension of organic society,  be it the kinship tie, communitarian forms of  
19:35
association, systems of self-governance, and  local allegiances - the sense of home and place.""
Conclusion: Going Home
19:46
This exploration of politics gives us a different  way of looking at why Animal Crossing is so  
19:51
popular. On a global scale, the series resonates  with people not just because it's cute, but  
19:56
because it gives us something that we're missing  from our lives. I know it may seem easy to dismiss  
20:01
these ideas, but they keep coming back: anarchism  finding life in three generations of Japanese  
20:07
radicals, furusato being revived after the war,  and anarchism having global appeal to this day.  
20:13
Capitalism never went away, so furusato and  anarchism didn't either. Animal Crossing brings  
20:19
community, and the politics that go with it, to  us today in a completely new format. There is  
20:24
this misconception that art happens in a vacuum,  that everything is created in an apolitical void,  
20:30
but there's no way an artist isn't thinking  about the world around them as they create.  
20:34
In the case of a Eguchi, he's moved to work for  Nintendo, he's lonely and he misses home. He's  
20:39
living in a country going through an economic  downturn while constantly being bombarded with  
20:43
advertising reminding him of village communities  that no longer exist. It's not just furusato,  
20:48
but capitalism that would have been on a Eguchi's  mind while developing Dōbutsu no Mori. But unlike  
20:54
furusato, capitalism is not present in the  series. He makes a game without poverty,  
20:59
inequality, where you're never short on rent  and your basic needs will always be met.  
21:04
He makes a game about a village, about community,  where you have friends and a place to be yourself,  
21:10
where you're free. He makes a game where he can  go home again. Animal Crossing isn't escapism,  
21:15
or the only way millennials will ever own a  house. It allows us to experience a different  
21:19
way of living, it shows us utopia. Even today,  a century after the Japanese anarchists, these  
21:25
ideas keep surfacing in our stories, films, and  video games. And in spite of capitalism cementing  
21:30
itself further into our lives, we keep dreaming  this dream and finding new ways to talk about it,  
21:35
ideas on how to make it reality. The quiet  revolution of New Horizons is that it asks us  
21:40
to consider what we are building while reminding  us that we're capable of being good to each other.  
21:45
It shows us that there's more to the  world and ourselves than we've been told.  
21:49
It lets us build a home to go home to.
22:18
Oh dear, there I go prattling on  about anarcho-communism again.  
22:23
I guess that doesn't qualify as news does it.
22:28
Oh well, have a great day out there!","Capitalism or community, choose one. Join us next time as we explore new horizons for social ecology.

Hi everyone. Welcome to this video.  My name is Tee if you're new here;  
0:03
I really do hope everyone's day is going well.
0:06
I really really do because let me go  ahead and address something on my mind.
0:12
[Jamaican patois]: pon mi  chest, pon mi heart everyting.
0:14
A couple days ago, I released my highly  anticipated review on the movie 'Malcolm & Marie,'
0:19
but I took it down in  less than 24 hours because in short,  
0:22
I just really wasn't all that proud of it.
0:24
Even though I worked really hard on it  and it was performing extremely well  
0:29
like the second best performing  video on my channel to this day.
0:32
And what that mean?
0:34
What that mean?
0:35
[Young Nudy]: ""I ain't  playing. I'm telling the truth.  
0:38
Ooh wee look what that money make a bitch do.""
0:41
But I do this I do this more than that I know  in my heart of hearts that if I still had 2,000  
0:46
subscribers and I wasn't gonna make a dime off of  that video, it would have never came out because  
0:51
I know deep deep down that I do not possess  what it takes to deconstruct a film like that.
0:56
At least not yet.
0:56
And it's funny because, for  those of you who watched it,  
0:59
I thought that because I wasn't critiquing  the technicalities of the movie and I was just  
1:05
going through the plot and sharing my observations  that I was avoiding looking like one of those  
1:11
prestigious, pretentious film critics that  everyone was pretending to be. But there was a  
1:15
point in the middle of my video where I veered off  from that initial um objective so she had to go.
1:21
Thank you to everyone who watched my video.
1:23
Sorry to everyone who didn't get a  chance to, but I gotta step my game up.
1:27
On to today's situation, I'm back.
1:31
I'm back to complain about  the Black woman's experience.
1:33
Yes I am. Yes I am.
1:35
A lane that I don't f*** up often.
1:36
I love a good laugh you know.
1:38
I already have pretty deep set smile  lines because I just love to laugh.
1:42
I'm very expressive in my face.
1:44
I mean y'all see me I open my mouth  really wide to speak.
1:47
I- it's above me now. I don't know why I do it either.
1:50
Anyway, I love a good laugh  and another thing I love to  
1:52
do is compare comedy throughout the  times to see how things have evolved.
1:56
Y'all already know, certain things that used to be  funny way back when can't really fly these days.
2:00
It just is what it is.
2:01
But if there's one thing that just never gets  old to people if there's one thing y'all gonna  
2:08
make sure sticks like motherf******  grits it's making fun of Black women.
2:13
It's ""humbling"" Black women.
2:15
It's humiliating Black women.
2:17
Embarrassing Black women is so normal, other  people become offended at us being offended.
2:24
[Nene Leakes]: ""You done lost your damn mind.  When you get your damn mind, you call me.""
2:28
Let's take it back to the good  old days to an app called Vine.
2:33
Now you youngins may not remember this, but  you can think of it as like a TikTok, Sr.
2:39
You know how TikTok's thing is dances  and POVs and sometimes a little music?
2:44
On Vine, it was skits.
2:46
6 second skits.
2:48
And that's so wild now that you think  about it like n***** really had us  
2:51
dying laughing with just six  seconds of our attention.
2:55
Vine was really a moment.
2:56
Okay so many people launched their careers  by delivering hyperbolized performances of  
3:00
stereotypical caricatures within their community.
3:03
The most popular one I was exposed to  was the Black mom, Black girlfriend,  
3:09
ratchet Black girl trope.
3:10
[@eastside_ivo]:""A multiple choice  one: you can get your ass beat, slap,  
3:13
tased or you can pick D bitch, all of the above.""
3:15
[@eastside_ivo]: ""Alright look you better gone  
3:16
about your business Chris cause  you do not want these problems.""
3:18
[@yungpoppy/@blameitonkway]:""Who  are you? Right. And where's your  
3:20
team? We don't want to know you sir.""
3:22
[@yungpoppy]:""Yes it is. You don't get  no hoes bro. You don't get no hoes bro.""
3:26
[@blameitonkway]:""What is it?  Am I not cute enough? Baby you  
3:28
know beautiful man. I even want  to get my hair straightened.""
3:30
[@yungpoppy]: ""I just want to let  you know that the unemployment  
3:32
office called today talking about  you ain't finished out no papers.""
3:35
[@yungpoppy]:""All up in my business homes.  
3:37
Cause you can't cook. Bitch see  that's why I'll whoop yo ass.""
3:41
[Dr. Umar]:""I don't hate none of  y'all. Y'all family. I love y'all.  
3:44
But we got to draw some lines.  This shit getting out of hand.""
3:48
While we at it, can somebody please make a video  on how big of an influence apps like Vine had  
3:54
on White kid's comfort and making comedy out  of POC existence because they saw us do it?
3:59
How it's a double-edged sword because at  the time we were laughing at it too because  
4:04
we didn't know no better but it created a  lot of legroom for this lucrative market  
4:09
of Black mockery by nonblack people  that now exists all over social media.
4:14
Anyway, people like
4:15
BlameitonKway, Yung Poppy, Eastside Ivo,  4everKelz they began amassing huge  
4:24
followings because people love relatability  comedy and that's usually how it starts out.
4:29
Jokes like these are funny in  the first half because people
4:32
within the community
4:34
love it when they can come  together, even with strangers,
4:37
within the community
4:39
and share a laugh. And in the first half,  we disregard the joke's problematic nature  
4:43
because we see ourselves or someone we  know in the jokes that are being told.  
4:47
And because it's usually our  own Black men, but not always,
4:51
Pat D. Lucky.
4:54
Who are making these jokes it's  rarely assumed that they're upkeeping  
4:57
the same biases that deny Black women jobs,  opportunities and really just basic respect.
5:03
Basic respect both outside and within
5:06
the community.
5:07
Do you know how many Black people  cannot stand the ""Titi's"" of real life?
5:11
Do you know how many Black people blame  them for being made fun of when in reality  
5:16
it's the Titi's of real life who are setting  the tone for popular fashion and trends?
5:21
The same popular fashion and trends that got your  favorite IG models in them high rise apartments?
5:25
Hold on.
5:26
Make it make sense.
5:27
The same women y'all are making fun of are the  foundations for these billion dollar industries.
5:34
All of this IG fashion, Fashion Nova, PLT.
5:38
Who is the blueprint?!
5:39
I'm also willing to die on the hill that-
5:41
actually put y'all seat belts on  because we're about to take it there.
5:44
So I'm willing to die on the hill that these men's  obsession with putting on wigs and makeup and  
5:50
nails and all of that is really just them taking  the opportunity to toy with gender expression.
5:54
As they should because that shit is fun.
5:56
But instead of doing so with they whole chest  and saying yes I'm a man who likes to put  
6:01
on wigs and makeup because no one is holding  a gun to my head; I'm doing it on my own accord
6:06
as I should.
6:07
Instead of doing that with pride, they  cower behind a veil of mocking Black women  
6:11
and that's what gives them a pass.
6:13
And actually we can take that a bit further  because a couple months ago I did a video called  
6:18
'Let's Talk Black Male  Femininity' something like that  
6:21
where I was basically celebrating  Black men who challenge gender norms.
6:27
Man did that set some of  y'all though the f*** off.
6:31
So many cis-het Black men in my comments
6:34
""Why are you trying to make it seem like it's  
6:35
so brave that Black men are  out here wearing dresses?""
6:38
""Why are you trying to normalize Black men  wearing nail polish?""
6:41
""I hate that bitches like you-""
6:44
I know!
6:45
""I hate that bitches like you have a  platform because you're poisoning the youth.""
6:49
[Jamaican patois]: Who heap of excitement right?
6:51
So here's what I'm gathering.
6:54
It's completely wrong and grotesque when Jaden  Smith poses in a skirt for a Louis Vuitton ad.
7:00
It's completely abominable when Lil Uzi  Vert and Young Thug and fucking Dennis  
7:06
Rodman confidently dress feminine because they  want to and because it makes them feel good  
7:11
but when other men do the exact same thing,  but they do it at the expense of Black women,
7:17
oh now it's okay?
7:19
Now it's allowed.
7:20
Now you follow.
7:21
Now you're tuned in and it's  cool and it's fun right?
7:26
I cannot lay this out any clearer for  you. Making fun of Black women is your  
7:30
safe space and you're not even clocking that.
7:33
That is y'all's first cover-up, your first  line of defense, your literal comfort zone  
7:39
and yo- like you don't even realize it.
7:41
Okay moving on these jokes and the fact  that they're made mainly by cis Black men  
7:46
perpetuate the stereotypes  that defeminize Black women  
7:49
and view us as a less deserving of  empathy and protection when we get hurt.
7:57
This color is wow.
8:00
Watered my crops
8:01
cleared my skin
8:03
and guess who made it?
8:08
I want to reference this article  I found on um
8:12
racism.org.
8:14
Yes, this is a real website
8:16
and no I did not come up with  it before y'all start with me.
8:20
It's been around since '95.
8:21
I wasn't even born yet.
8:22
So the article is called '""Hit  it and Quit It"": Responses to  
8:25
Black Girls' Victimization in School'  written by Sonja or Sonja C. Tonnesen.
8:30
I apologize if there was any mispronunciation.
8:32
Let's take it to part two subsection a
8:35
Defeminization.
8:37
Tonnesen writes: ""The masculinization and  defeminization of Black women and girls  
8:42
is one form of implicit bias that contributes  to social approval of violence against them.
8:48
When a woman or girl is perceived as masculine  she is also more likely to be seen as strong  
8:53
aggressive and less feminine these traits are  typically associated with gender conforming men
9:00
and consequently, such implicit bias  may cause a school administrator
9:04
people in this case
9:05
to perceive sexually victimized Black girls as  capable of handling the harassment themselves  
9:10
(like men) and in less need of  protection. In extreme cases,  
9:13
these girls are even misperceived as  the primary aggressors against boys.""
9:18
You know what this sounds like?
9:20
A couple months ago, our beloved  Megan Thee Stallion was shot  
9:23
and I gotta say before we even dive into this
9:26
y'all want Megan to think she's ugly so bad
9:30
it's gross.
9:31
Y'all have been trying to  strip her of her femininity  
9:33
and her right to love herself out loud for so long
9:37
it's gross.
9:40
Gr- couple wet wipes case a bum try to touch me
9:43
ew.
9:44
You know what I mean?
9:45
Gross.
9:46
So our beloved Stalli
9:47
She was shot with a real gun
9:49
and real bullets
9:49
in her real feet.
9:50
And instead of the conversation being about  how the hell are we going to get hating ass  
9:56
motherfuckers like Snory Lamez out of  the industry and punished appropriately.
10:02
Instead of the conversation being about  how we can uplift her and show her empathy  
10:07
in a time where someone she trusted inflicted  violence upon her and publicly humiliated her.
10:12
All of a sudden, n***** is PIs.
10:16
Private Investigators
10:17
with degrees from Twitter University.
10:19
And instead the conversation turned to ""well  maybe we should suss out the facts first.
10:25
I don't know if we should just believe  a Black woman who says she's been hurt.
10:30
It's kind of weird don't you think?""
10:32
People were antagonizing her so much,  
10:34
they were calling her a liar so much, she felt the  need to post a picture of her bullet-ridden foot  
10:40
to Instagram.
10:42
And this was after  everybody had access to the video.
10:44
We saw the- oh my gosh.
10:46
I hate to relive this because like but we saw  the video of her limping out of the car and her  
10:53
foot was leaking on the freaking floor so y'all  been had your proof but that still wasn't enough.
10:57
Then the conversation turned to ""okay  so maybe she did get shot okay fine  
11:02
but what did she do to deserve it?
11:04
She's tall
11:05
she thick
11:06
she a boss bitch right?
11:07
She couldn't defend herself? Maybe  this will finally humble her.""
11:13
But these are just jokes right?
11:16
They don't perpetuate biases that literally  justify violence against us, right?
11:21
And even if it isn't physical  violence people's eagerness  
11:24
to make Black women's pain a laughing  stock? That shit gotta go, too.
11:28
Tessica Brown aka 'Gorilla Glue Lady' the  way y'all took her simple mistake and moment  
11:34
of vulnerability as an opportunity to  disrespect her, send her death threats  
11:39
and make her the laughing stock of the  internet for like three weeks straight..
11:45
Are we weirdos or are we weirdos?
11:47
Like the jokes tell themselves bro  like y'all write these videos for me.
11:51
Why oh why was it so difficult for  people to either empathize with her pain  
11:56
or just not say anything at all?
11:59
Why oh why was it so easy for people to one  
12:02
make up the rumor that she was trying to  sue Gorilla Glue or two believe it?
12:08
I know that was some stupid ass shit she did by  
12:10
spraying that gorilla glue on  her head but y'all it's done.
12:13
It happened.
12:14
Can we stop acting like y'all  are so much smarter than thou.
12:17
I remember in high school bitches was  using weave glue to put on their eyelashes.
12:23
Let's not act like we're so far removed from the  f****** cinnamon challenge or eating Tide pods  
12:28
or what was that shit called when motherf******  used to plank off of the side of buildings?!
12:32
Humans do stupid shit and they make mistakes.
12:35
We're all idiots to some  capacity it just so happens that  
12:37
her mistake was catastrophic and it went viral.
12:39
Nobody is forcing you to feel bad for her
12:42
nobody is forcing you to donate to her GoFundMe.
12:44
No,  
12:45
I didn't feel that bad for her at first but in the  very least I didn't feel the need to attack her.
12:50
Black women really cannot make  no mistakes in y'all presence
12:53
none
12:54
because y'all just be waiting  to turn us into a joke.
12:56
And I know majority of you understand  this because you have functioning brains  
13:00
but let me just throw in a little  checkpoint for those who do not.
13:04
These Vine videos are not the  direct cause of things like this.
13:08
Vine videos were not the direct  cause of Megan getting hurt.
13:12
Vine videos were not the direct cause of  Tessica being attacked on the internet.
13:16
But the culture of making those videos
13:18
the reason people think to laugh at  them in the first place support it.
13:22
They support the bias which leads  to the discrimination which keeps  
13:26
the normality of our mistreatment  alive it's really that simple.
13:30
Now while the men who were playing these  characters went on to continue their careers  
13:34
on apps like Instagram and YouTube, many of them  moved on to greater ventures and life journeys  
13:40
many of them just grew up and  realized this shit is kind of whack.
13:44
We even got a couple apologies.
13:46
While some of them have held  onto these caricatures so tight  
13:51
I think they fucking fingers is about to fall off.
13:55
Relatability comedy.
13:56
Remember how I said they had us in the first half?
13:59
They did.
14:00
The reinvention of the Madea
14:02
of the Sheneneh
14:03
but this time with more modernized  jokes on more modernized social media.
14:08
Of course you did have us in the first  half, but listen to me the game is over.
14:12
The game's been over for 10 years.
14:16
Vine started in what 2012?
14:18
What year are we in now?
14:20
The jig is up
14:21
because at this point we've heard it all before.
14:24
The mammy trope? We get it.
14:26
The angry Black woman trope? We get it.
14:28
The ratchet Black woman trope? We fucking get it.
14:31
Half of these tropes been around since before  
14:33
our freaking parents were born so  it's gonna take a lot to convince me  
14:37
that society and pop culture is still laughing  at the jokes themselves but rather finding a way  
14:43
to express their true desire to disrespect  and embarrass us but in the name of comedy.
14:48
My favorite example of this is the phenomenon  of pulling off Black women's wigs in public.
14:54
Oh my gosh
14:55
I'm gonna have to call on Jesus Devonte Christ  for this one because it's Him and Him alone
15:00
him and him alone who could calm me  down from the instant rage that just  
15:04
washes over me every time I think about  how and why this stuff is still happening.
15:09
Little personal interjection back when I used to  wear wigs back when I was all about the wig tings
15:15
one of my biggest fears I  mean like crippling fears  
15:18
was that someone would nuff up themselves  in public and try to pull my shit off.
15:23
And what scared me the most wasn't  even the embarrassment which since  
15:26
it never happened to me I can  only imagine is unbearable,  
15:29
but what really really terrified me was that  if this were to happen I wouldn't be allowed  
15:34
to react naturally and appropriately because  I would just be expected to take the joke.
15:40
And what's even worse is you don't only have  to worry about a stranger doing that to you.
15:44
Little story time
15:45
So one time I was goofing around with my cousin.
15:48
We were I don't want to say play  fighting because like we're adults
15:52
we're grown
15:52
we don't play fight.
15:53
But he reached for me
15:54
and okay we were play fighting
15:57
maybe we're not grown.
15:58
And I see his hand come toward my head  and I was like ""Do not pull off my wig!""
16:01
Party over immediately.
16:03
I was like ""On your mother, I will  fucking kill you. Do not pull off my wig"".
16:06
He was like ""What?! Why would I do that? Like  
16:10
I wouldn't violate you like  that. That's not even funny"".
16:12
And that was the first time my fears about  that were even validated I was like yeah  
16:17
it's not funny huh?
16:19
Anyway, humiliating Black women is so  normalized it'd be your own people.
16:22
""Come here. Look at this Nick, I want you  to keep the water in your mouth if you think  
16:25
everything about this is real. All right go  ahead. You see Nick this is my whole thing.""
16:33
""You're a victim. There we go, CSI.""
16:36
Listen, I understand it's a comedy show
16:39
you're meant to crack jokes on each other
16:41
you're meant to goof off
16:42
I get that
16:43
I so get that
16:45
also R.I.P. Wild 'n Out that show was a true  gem and I really hope it can be revived one day.
16:49
Actually I heard it is getting revived  so once I find out where that's gonna  
16:53
be I'll definitely be watching,  but that shit was not all right.
16:57
Just think about the level of exposure
17:00
her hair was a key element of her appearance  that day like you look at her and that's the  
17:06
first thing you noticed about her and  what did he say before he snatched it?
17:09
You think this is all real right?
17:11
You think she's all real?
17:13
*snatch*
17:14
How real is she now?
17:16
How beautiful is she now?
17:17
How authentic is she now?
17:20
And in all the videos I watched of Black  women getting their wigs pulled off
17:23
because there is a plethora of them  on these God forsaken internets.
17:27
When it happens it's never like a  grab and drop on the floor or grab  
17:31
and give it back which would still  be fucked up but it's never that.
17:34
It's a grab and wave it in the air.
17:36
A grab and you got to be quicker than that they'd  be waving it in the air like it's some kind of  
17:42
prize or trophy like look I have your dignity and  and your pride and all your beauty in my hand.
17:50
It's sick.
17:51
And I'm getting sick and tired of Black women  constantly being expected to take one for the team  
17:58
and take it like a champ because anybody else  for any other reason will be able to yell and
18:04
[Jamaican patois]: cuss and gwan bad
18:06
but you walk down the street right now  and you pull off a non-black woman's hat
18:11
just her hat
18:12
they kicking up hell as they should and  their anger is going to be understood  
18:17
and their perpetrators will be dealt with.
18:20
But that same person could pull off my whole wig
18:23
again a key element of my appearance
18:26
and I'm just expected to  be like ""boy you so crazy"".
18:30
I'm sick of y'all gaslighting our  emotions and saying it's no big deal  
18:34
it was just a joke when you know the reason you  did that in the first place was not light-hearted.
18:39
I'm supposed to have a light-hearted reaction when  
18:41
your intentions were rooted in the pits  of motherf******* Hell you s******* me?!
18:44
Stop treating these n***** like they stupid  they know the value of hair to a woman
18:47
especially a Black woman.
18:49
They know that for hundreds of years our hair  has been used as a crutch to humiliate us  
18:54
thus the stakes for us are different  
18:58
very very different i have literally seen  non-black women take their hair out in public.
19:04
Jeannie Mai even talked about this a couple  years ago on 'The Real' she was saying how one  
19:09
of her favorite things to do after a long day  of wearing a hair piece or clip-ins is to just
19:17
and plop it right there on the table  in a restaurant full of people.
19:21
And of course when she told that  story nobody looked at her sideways.
19:24
Of course the only person  who was like huh? was Tamar.
19:27
Now why don't you tell me if  someone like Tamar Braxton
19:31
an OG wig wearer were to do something like that.
19:34
If Tamar Braxton sat at a dinner table and just
19:39
and paparazzi caught a glimpse of that why  don't you tell me what the headlines would be.
19:44
This is not the fault of Jeannie.
19:46
This is not the fault of the nonblack women who  could just willy-nilly take their hair out or off.
19:51
And it's no big deal they  did not create this problem  
19:54
but I mean I- I don't think they did  but they can do that and we can't.
19:58
Why?
20:00
They can do that and we can't.
20:03
Why?
20:04
Because then we're branded ratchet
20:07
then we baldhead and ugly, defeminized and  
20:11
all of the negative stereotypes you've  assigned to us without our permission.
20:15
Again, pop culture continues to keep these  dusty ass jokes and antics alive not because  
20:21
they have any true comedic standing, but because  it's a medium for you to humiliate us and that  
20:27
that is what people never want to die.
20:29
So I want to pose an open-ended question  because I need y'all's help I'm gonna read it
20:35
Okay given we live in a society that  already actively seeks to destroy black  
20:40
women for simply existing I would like to  know what else is left to humble? And why?
20:48
What do you gain from said humbling? And why?
20:56
Why can't we exist in our confidence  without a whole ass market
21:00
a lucrative, thriving market of  people who want to tear that down?
21:07
Question number 3, is it the  resilience that pisses you off?
21:15
Is it because every stereotype you create or  everything you try to shame us for we reclaim it?
21:21
Y'all make fun of ratchet and hood Black  women and we turn that into a whole aesthetic  
21:25
all up in the Grammys with the shit.
21:26
You threaten to pull our wigs off in public  and we come up with the strongest bonding  
21:30
glue lace adhesive that shit probably could  have patched at the Titanic while you playing.
21:35
You scorn our natural features  and we tell you to get used to  
21:38
this negro nose because it's  not going no fucking where.
21:41
Is that what's really bothering you?
21:44
Because let me tell you this is not the  fun game of catch that y'all think it is.
21:49
I of course can't speak for all  Black women but I would assume  
21:53
we would like it if we could just  have some shit and just enjoy it  
21:58
and not have to reinvent it because people  keep trying to steal it or mock us for it.
22:03
I would assume that's a strong assumption
22:05
Black women do not need to be humbled  
22:07
if history has not told you  already you can't you can't do it.
22:11
How do the kids be saying that these days?
22:12
We just ""built different"" you know?
22:15
We will always find a way to come  out on top it's that type of shit.
22:18
What's not clicking.
22:19
Thank you all so much for watching.
22:20
Especially if you made it all  the way to the end of the video.
22:23
I have a feeling this is kind of a long one.
22:25
I tried to make it a little bit longer  than usual because I still feel kind of bad  
22:29
that I took down the 'Malcolm & Marie' video so yeah.
22:33
Thanks if you made it all the way here  and another thing before I wrap this up  
22:37
my hoodie today is from 'Advantageous'.
22:40
No this is not sponsored but do  y'all even know what that means  
22:43
because when I was just a viewer I  didn't know what none of that shit means.
22:46
Okay, let me just tell you real quick.
22:47
A sponsored video means that a  company paid a creator to dedicate  
22:52
a certain amount of time to promoting their  product, but just because someone says  
22:56
this video is not sponsored  doesn't mean they didn't get paid.
23:01
There's also paid promo which means a company  paid someone to mention their product real quick.
23:05
Like if I were to say oh and by the  way guys these rings are from Pandora  
23:08
even though that was real quick  I could have got a check for it.
23:11
I didn't, but if it was a paid promo I could have.
23:14
This hoodie was sent to me for free  so I guess it would be considered PR,  
23:19
but there was never any agreement like hey if  I send you this for free can you promote it.
23:24
No I didn't even promise her if I  liked it that I would promote it.
23:27
She just sent me a gift and I fucks with it so  much I'm like yeah I gotta get in on it so yeah.
23:32
This is the 'Create Success'  hoodie um right here it says
23:36
let me let me scoot up
23:38
uh I need to hit this with a lint roller.
23:39
Anyway it says 'Create Success'  right here and it's embroidered
23:43
not printed that's important.
23:45
That means it'll last longer um but on the side  this part is printed it's um it says advantageous  
23:50
the definition and everything  so it's ""an adjective involving  
23:54
or creating favorable circumstances  that increase the chances of success""
23:57
I know that's motherfucking right and then  I think it says something on the back too.
24:02
Chile okay so yeah this is I'm really  I really don't remember what it says  
24:10
on the back so you can just uh read it I guess.
24:13
Oh and the box hold on
24:14
I had to show you the box.
24:16
Yes, I kept the box.
24:17
It's a good box.
24:18
So it says 'Advantageous' is it and then  right here right here it says 'Create Success'  
24:25
and I had to keep this box because  look how cool this is right?
24:29
So you open it and it it's a magnet like what?
24:35
It's it's very similar to um 'Forvr Mood's'-  Forvr Mood's Valentine's Day collection which  
24:42
y'all want some thoughts about  that too because I have many.
24:44
And then now I don't know if y'all gonna get all  of this special treatment but I was sent a note  
24:51
um so here it is it says ""Tee Noir  content: One boss to another."".
24:59
Stop fucking playing with me.
25:05
I got a little I got a little  gift card with a little pro  
25:09
let me stop because if y'all don't get this  I don't want nobody coming for me but I-  
25:13
I think this is special treatment and I  got a handwritten note and it's cardboard.
25:17
Ain't cardboard biodegradable? you  saving the planet and shit too.
25:22
No no this is too sweet.
25:23
I'm not going to read it.
25:24
It's personal.
25:25
I know Black capitalism will not save the  world but obviously marginalization breeds  
25:30
creativity because for this to be a small Black  owned business and they giving it up like this.

Bye.","Hey cuties welcome back :) In today's video I'm sharing my thoughts on social media's obsession with humiliating Black women in the name of comedy and using that to support my greater theory of society's weird enjoyment of Black women's pain.

Greetings and salutations, before we get into all this, uh, this video's been brought to you by NordVPN.
0:05
Thanks to NordVPN for sponsoring this... um... thirty minute nightmare.
0:20
It’s September 14th, 2008. Scholastic Press publishing has released the first  
0:26
installment in Suzanne Collins’ sci-fi  adventure trilogy The Hunger Games. The book’s partly inspired by the  myth of Theseus and the Minotaur  
0:34
in which children are sent as sacrifices into  a labyrinth to be devoured by a bloodthirsty...
0:40
you guessed it: minotaur. This was done to stave off a  plague that had befallen Athens. In the world of The Hunger Games, two children  from twelve districts are sent to The Capitol,  
0:49
the wealthiest and most  inaccessible part of the country, to be killed for the entertainment of rich people  
0:54
as punishment to the districts  for uprising years earlier. The Hunger Games would get a lot of comparisons  to the masterpiece Battle Royale to the point  
1:02
that Collins’ name would occasionally be  eviscerated online for shits and giggles. But besides the initial concept, the  stories are very different and they’re  
1:10
also both basically Theseus and the Minotaur  and the 10th Victim, the Elio Petri film about  
1:15
something called The Big Hunt, a game show  where spectators watch hunters kill prey. [gratuitous deep inhale]
1:20
So whatever. When it was published, 50,000 copies of the book  were released and that number continued to climb.
1:26
Suffice it to say it was very fucking popular. It’s March 2009, a few months after the release of  the first book, and the production company Color  
1:35
Force has acquired the rights to adapt the book  to film and Lionsgate enters the deal with them.
1:41
And this is where our story starts.
1:53
The Hunger Games rollout happened pretty fast. The first book was released in 2008 and by  2015, just seven years later, the last of  
2:01
the trilogy’s movie adaptations had grossed  over 600 million dollars at the box office. The movie counterparts marked the beginning of a
2:08
wave of YA Dystopian novels  adapted for the big screen. Right after this first installment,  we’d get adaptations of Ender’s Game,  
2:15
The Maze Runner, The 5th Wave and many more. Out of all of them, Hunger Games was the  most competent and fulfilling series.
2:23
But we’re not there yet. We’re here on April 4th of 2011, Lionsgate  announces the official casting of three actors.
2:30
Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen, Josh Hutcherson -- who publicly campaigned  for his part -- as Peeta Mallark
2:36
and Liam Hemsworth as Gale Hawthorne. And fans are excited.
2:43
No, I’m kidding, a lot of them were really mad. I'm absolutely heartsick right now.
2:48
Gary Ross and Nina Jacobson have completely ruined  this amazing book with such horrible casting.
2:55
Josh will never be my Peeta!  What a disappointment! I have no enthusiasm for  this movie at all anymore.
3:03
This is the biggest fail since  Charlie Sheen's Warlock tour. I will not support this doomed project.
3:08
For God's sake Josh is terrible! Hunter Parrish  as Peeta would be a thousand times better.
3:14
Terrible casting all around! None of  them are right. What a disappointment. OH MY GOD I HATE THIS CASTING!
3:20
Peeta and Gale's casting  people should be switched! Peeta is a blonde buff guy  like the guy casted for Gale!
3:28
And Gale is dark haired like the  guy casted -- cated -- for Peeta! I hope they're willing to get their hair dyed!
3:34
Also Katnis is supposed to have long, dark hair,  not medium-length blonde hair and by the way
3:39
I think she looks way too old to play Katniss too! The casting is all wrong! Also, I heard some old guy is playing Haymitch!  
3:47
NOOOOO! Johnny Depp or someone  like that is perfect for that role! OH MY GOD THIS IS ALL WRONG!
3:53
I HATE IT BECAUSE I LOOOOOOVE THIS BOOK IT'S MY FAVORITE BOOK EVERRRRRR!!!!!!!!!
4:00
Jesus Christ... Casting has always sparked  controversy among fandoms. Whether its people having ulcers over  Robert Pattinson playing Edward Cullen
4:09
or people having ulcers over  Robert Pattinson playing Batman, casting is a thing that  causes a lot of excitement.
4:15
It should be said before I get into all of the  stuff that’s about to unfold that generally,   fandoms are disdainful of all casting decisions.
4:23
It is impossible to satisfy them. Josh Hutcherson is too brunette,  he couldn’t possibly dye his hair?
4:29
What even is bleach? Did you make that up? Liam Hemsworth couldn’t possibly play Gale,   he’s blonde? There’s no such thing  as hair dye, stop lying to yourself.
4:39
And Jennifer Lawrence, among  other things, couldn’t possibly   play Katniss because she can’t dye her  hair and her ribcage isn’t protruding.
4:46
Ugh, this is all messed up. But eventually, Josh grew on people. At  the time that he was announced as Peeta,  
4:52
I was honestly really excited because Josh was  exactly who I envisioned Peeta looking like.  
4:58
Short and stocky with a friendly smile. Are  you kidding me? Who else was it gonna be?
5:11
Awwww. No. More castings would be announced  and a few days later on April 18th  
5:16
2011, characters Rue and Thresh would be cast  by actors Amandla Stenberg and Dayo Okeniyi.
5:23
For the most part, the response was good. The publications that posted about the  casting choices don’t have comments on  
5:29
them and the few that do have one or  two comments, are thankfully positive. A lot of fans seemed to really like Amandla as  Rue. And when you go to a video that ClevverTV  
5:38
posted about the casting, many of the comments  were people expressing sadness not because   Amandla was cast but because she was so cute,  people didn’t want to see her character die.
6:07
While it may seem as if there was no  backlash until after the movie came out which almost never happens,
6:13
once upon a time, these casting  announcements were made on news   sites and the posts were flooded with outrage.
6:19
Since those comments -- and all  comments -- have since been removed,   the full scope of anger is missing from history.
6:26
But you can still find a few comments on  YouTube videos that included the announcement. And even on those old fan cast videos.
6:33
Going back to look at those dream casts,  I found that, more often than not, a white actress was chosen for Rue.
6:39
And the rare videos that included a black actress  for the role would get comments like these: I also imagined Rue as white thus her resembling  Prim...I think that's why it was confusing.
6:51
Rue was supposed to have olive skin. *OLIVE.* I'm  sure this was just done for political correctness!
6:58
Ugh, that's Rue? I'm sorry but she doesn't  seem like Rue. I thought Rue would have
7:06
lighter hair. Dude! I think it's perfect. Not what I  thought Thresh would look like but still.  
7:11
I imagined a big buff white dude as him. ""The boy tribute from District 11,  Thresh, has the same dark skin as Rue
7:19
but the resemblance stops there."" They were in the minority and their  racism went unseen by the mainstream.
7:24
It wasn't until after the movie was released  on March 23, *2012* (not 2011, you dumb fuck) that Twitter started to do what Twitter does
7:32
The difference between the  disappointment surrounding   Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth is that A)
7:37
people weren't being racist and B) No one took screenshots.
9:03
The thing is Rue and Thresh were  described as being black in the book. Or, okay, if you want to get technical about it:  they were described as having dark brown skin.
9:12
And I know that the Hunger Games thing  with District 11 is very messy stuff.
9:18
I might handle that in a different  video all together because there's so much to unpack there.
9:24
The only character cast with a Black  actor whose skin color wasn’t described   as being brown or any other  color for that matter was Cinna.
9:32
but if you’re complaining about  Lenny Kravitz being cast in a movie,   that sounds like a you problem. As in a you have no taste problem.
9:38
Why is Cinna Black?! There’s been a long-standing history  in Hollywood to replace characters  
9:44
of color with white characters or  to keep the characters' race the   same but have those characters  still played by white actors.
9:49
In recent years, we’ve seen this most frequently  with American live action anime adaptations. Changing Light Yagami to Light Turner,
9:56
casting Justin Chatwin as Goku and a tree playing Motoko Kusanagi. And that’s just the newer stuff  because this dates back decades.
10:04
The list is exhaustive. The movie Hud, for which the leading  actress Patricia Neal won an Oscar.
10:09
In the book, this character was originally Black. This was changed because the  producers didn’t think it was   possible for a Black woman to be so desired.
10:16
In Pay it Forward, Kevin Spacey’s  character was, in the book, a Black man. In the adaptation process, it was  decided that he wasn’t anymore.
10:23
And in Warm Bodies, the character played by   Analeigh Tipton was described in  the book as being half Ethiopian.
10:29
But I guess that didn’t work for the story. And literally no one who read Warm Bodies  pre film adaptation seemed to mind.
10:35
Although Lavender Brown, a character in the Harry   Potter series, was never described  as any particular race or color,
10:41
she was initially cast in the  movies with Black actresses. Twice. But when it came time for Lavender to   have a speaking part and to play a  more important role in the story,
10:49
she was replaced with a white actress. While a lot of fans did have gripes with  this installment in the film franchise,
10:55
none of those qualms had anything to  do with Lavender suddenly being white. It’s likely that no one noticed and it’s  just as likely that anyone who did notice  
11:03
simply didn’t care. So, characters like Rue and Thresh,  if they’d been cast with white actors,  
11:09
would have been far from the first characters  in the history of cinema to be whitewashed. The sad thing is that if  they had been whitewashed,  
11:16
the fans wouldn’t even have noticed  because clearly few of them, despite being such “huge” fans of  the Hunger Games series seemed to  
11:23
pick up on the key descriptions  of the characters to begin with:
11:37
My guess is that the Einsteins  who “read” the book lacked reading   comprehension skills and dismissed the  first part in favor of the second part
11:44
where Katniss says Rue reminds her of  Prim *because* of her size and demeanor. So, Rue was always a black character. And  it was one of the few and first times that  
11:53
such a character was cast with an actor  who somewhat matches the description. Because colorism.
11:59
Put a pin in that. But despite these characters and the color  of their skin literally being described   more than once, a section of Hunger Games fans  were still unreasonably surprised because white  
12:09
fans in particular are very used to being the only  kind of people who exist in their favorite books. And this is especially true with  science fiction and fantasy novels.
12:17
Western literature in general tends to center  white writers and, in doing so, centers whiteness.
12:22
How many times have you found yourself reading a   book and noticing when an author  describes a character as being Black or Asian or Hispanic?
12:29
It feels sudden not only because this is the first  character of color you've come across in the book but because no other characters have  had their race or skin color described.
12:38
And you realize: ""Oh. They don't need the description because  they are understood to be white.""
12:44
This technique makes whiteness the standard,   the default and it effectively  others anything that isn't that.
12:50
In 2012, one of my all time  favorite writers Zadie Smith released her fourth novel NW.
12:56
It follows four different characters and it’s a  pretty experimental book with some passages being   written in third person, others in first  person and varying narrative techniques.
13:04
But my favorite element about the novel is that   Smith doesn’t describe the race of  any character unless they’re white,
13:09
effectively subverting what  has become an accepted norm in   western literature of whiteness  being the neutral or default.
13:15
When asked about her decision  to do this, Smith said: ""I grew up reading a generation of American  and English people like Bellow, Updike or Amis.  
13:24
Everybody's neutral unless they're black — then  you hear about it: the black man, the black woman,  
13:29
the black person. Of course, if you happen  to be black the world doesn't look that way   to you. I just wanted to try and create perhaps a  sense of alienation and otherness in this person,  
13:38
the white reader, to remind them that  they are not neutral to other people."" That same year that the first Hunger Games  film was released, casting choices for the  
13:46
film adaptation of Cassandra Clare’s novel The  Mortal Instruments: City of Bones was announced.
13:51
In July, news broke that the late and great  actor Godfrey Gao was going to play Magnus Bane.
13:57
Again, most fans were happy with this casting.  But there were others who were extremely upset
14:02
that an Asian character was  being played by an Asian actor.
14:20
What is y'all's thing with Adam  Lambert? Can we please stop?
14:43
You did! On Tumblr, Cassandra Clare was asked  by a fan if she could please explain  
14:49
to her racist fans why an Asian actor  was going to play an Asian character. Because there seemed to be a  lot of confusion on Facebook.
14:56
Cassandra Clare said: “...I am  confused about the confusion.   They want an Asian actor to play  Magnus because Magnus is Asian…”
15:05
She went on to show sections of  what she’d written in the book,   lines that clearly point out Magnus is half  Indonesian and speaks Indonesian a few times.
15:13
She couldn’t have made it any clearer that  Magnus was not white. Or not only white. “I remember being told early on in the whole  movie process (before I sold the rights)
15:23
that I should be wary about having  written a biracial character, because if there is any excuse  to cast a character as white,  
15:30
even if they are not, even if they are  only half, Hollywood will take it…” “The general assumption that is always made  about characters is that they are white.
15:38
I am constantly asked if Jem is Chinese,  even though he is from Shanghai and speaks   Mandarin and says he is Chinese and is portrayed  on the cover of the book by a half-Chinese model.
15:48
Apparently the idea he might not be white is  just that startling. And why is it startling?
15:54
Because of things like whitewashing. Because  if mainstream media can take an opportunity to   accord more privilege to the already privileged,  and make everybody white, by and large they will.
16:03
And every time it happens, it contributes to the  problem and makes sure the problem lasts longer. So why are they casting Asian actors  for Magnus? Because Magnus is Asian.”
16:30
For centuries, art has featured  white people as the primary subjects. Whiteness is considered by many to be the default.
16:37
Studios don’t question whether a teenage black   girl will be able to relate to a  story about a teenage white girl.
16:43
It’s not even considered. They ask if white girls will be able to relate to  black girls and then decide they can't, which ends  
16:49
in black girls getting little to no light-hearted  stories about high school or coming of age. The reason often given for these  decisions is that white people  
16:58
are incapable of relating to  characters that aren’t white. Which sounds like a load of shit given Hollywood’s  history of telling stories about black,  
17:05
Asian and Indigenous characters  while having white actors play them. The popularity of the story of Othello, the  popularity of movies like The Conquerer,  
17:12
the infamous film about Genghis Khan  where he’s played by John Wayne,   are testaments to the truth that  white audiences have always been  
17:19
interested in stories about people  of a different race and culture. Perhaps, the distinction is  that they’ve always been more  
17:25
comfortable with white actors playing these roles. With the exception of Ira Aldridge, it was  the norm for white actors to play Othello.
17:31
In fact, the first instance of a  Black actor, Laurence Fishburne,   playing Othello in a mainstream  studio film wouldn’t be until 1995.
17:40
So, even when characters are explicitly described  as being Black or Asian, you’ll still have white  
17:45
audience members who ask if that’s really  their race and if it actually matters. Some people are so used to  whiteness being the default,
17:53
they view it as the norm and any deviation  from that norm is looked at with suspicion. Every time there’s been a case of  whitewashing in anime for instance  
18:00
and people of color are rightfully upset  about having an opportunity taken from them,   there’s always a counter defense  from white audience members.
18:06
It gets to a point that they’ll claim characters  with Japanese names who live in Japan and speak   Japanese are actually white and that anyone  who watches anime would be able to see that.
18:16
Then at the same time, they say that  race shouldn’t matter at all unless   it’s pertinent to the story. And if a Black  character is leading a film where the theme  
18:23
isn’t centered around their race, people  will get upset and claim the character’s   only Black because of political correctness.  Because people who aren’t white only exist  
18:31
because of political correctness and not because  we were born into the world like everyone else. The whole thing with only casting people of  color if their race is important to the story  
18:40
is how we get so many movies and books about  how hard it is to be a person of color. We get stories with a mostly Black cast where it’s  all about Black trauma and Black pain because,  
18:50
even though our experiences with race will  never disengage from our everyday life,   stories about Black people just existing without  
18:57
their race being the main focus is seen  as an unnecessary result of PC culture. After scouring social media to see if I could find  more reactions to the Rue situation around that  
19:07
time period, I found one who read the Hunger  Games and did see that description of Rue.   And they straight up admitted that although  they saw that the character had dark brown skin,  
19:16
they just kind of assumed Suzanne Collins meant  olive skin, that Rue was Sicillian or something.
19:22
And, you know, I guess that’s valid but I feel  like if Suzanne Collins wanted to write that Rue   had an olive skin tone, she would have just  written that she had an olive skin tone...
19:32
You know, kinda like she  did with Katniss and Gale?
19:43
Don't know how one substitutes  olive for dark brown but okay. Most of the racist outrage we  see with casting choices today  
19:50
come with the news of actors of color  playing traditionally white characters. Which makes this case so bizarre because apart  
19:57
from writing that Rue was  Black every other sentence, I’m not sure how Suzanne Collins could have  made it more obvious that she was Black.
20:04
For that piece of information though, some  people just refused to acknowledge it. When all the racist attacks were going on,  
20:09
there was one YouTube commenter who  summed up the reactions pretty well:
20:33
The racist reactions to a black character   being played by a black actress  was obviously unwarranted and
20:39
incredibly fucking stupid. Authors were panicking about how  their readers were perceiving   their obviously Black coded characters,
20:46
teachers across the country  were scrambling to reintroduce   basic reading comprehension  skills into their curriculum.
20:53
Guys, it was cataclysmic. And the thing is, at the end of the day,   although a Black actress was chosen for the  part, the casting directors still got it wrong.
21:01
Let’s return to the descriptions of Rue, shall we? “She’s the twelve year old, the one  that reminded me so of Prim in stature.  
21:08
Up close she looks about ten. She has  bright, dark eyes and satiny brown skin.”
21:14
""She has dark brown skin..."" Yes, Rue is a dark-skinned black girl.
21:20
The racism toward her character didn’t begin   nor did it end with Amandla  Stenberg being in the movie.
21:26
It began in the casting room where the decision   was made to cast a light-skinned  biracial actress for the role.
21:32
And, you know, props to Amandla because I  do think she brought Rue to life beautifully but that doesn’t change the  fact that her casting was yet  
21:38
another instance of a dark-skinned  actress being erased from a film. On one hand, the filmmakers did a  disservice to Rue by casting her this way  
21:46
and on the other, I know that had  she been a little dark-skinned girl,   the vitriol and racism the actress  received would have been ten times worse.
21:54
One of the tweets that popped up read: “When I  found out Rue was Black her death wasn’t as sad.”
21:59
Comments like these were just the  tip of the iceberg of a larger issue. The issue being that Black girls are perceived  to be less innocent than white girls and that  
22:08
dark skinned Black girls are perceived to be  less innocent that light skinned Black girls. There’s an actual study confirming that  and I recommend everyone reading it.
22:16
Girlhood Interrupted: The  Erasure of Black Girls’ Childhood   focuses on the adultification of young Black  girls and how, as early as five years old,  
22:25
they’re perceived to be older and  less innocent and more culpable. “Across all age ranges, participants viewed Black  girls collectively as more adult than white girls.  
22:34
Responses revealed, in particular, that  participants perceived Black girls as needing   less protection and nurturing than white  girls, and that Black girls were perceived  
22:42
to know more about adult topics and are more  knowledgeable about sex than their white peers.” “...beginning as early as 5 years of age,  
22:49
Black girls were more likely to be viewed as  behaving and seeming older than their stated   age; more knowledgeable about adult topics,  including sex; and more likely to take on  
22:59
adult roles and responsibilities than what  would have been expected for their age.” In 2013, Quevenzhane Wallis became the  youngest person to be nominated for Best  
23:08
Actress in a Leading Role at the Academy Awards.  Leading up to this and following it, she was   constantly ridiculed by the media. Her name was  mocked, she became a punching bag for certain  
23:17
celebrities and news outlets. The Onion made a  headline calling her a cunt. At nine-years-old!  
23:23
Why, you might be wondering, did such a thing  happen to other young nominees? Like Anna Paquin  
23:28
for instance? No. This little Black girl, for some  reason, was perceived by many to be a grown woman.
23:35
""Had you watched Annie as a little girl?"" ""When I heard that they were --  well, I'm still a little girl.""
23:40
""Those of lighter skin are  awarded social and economic   privileges because of their closer  phenotypic resemblance to whites  
23:47
and their assumed superior social value  relative to their darker-skinned counterparts."" And here's how that translates into Hollywood:
23:54
That racial empathy gap makes them  believe it is impossible for white   audiences to relate to anyone who's Black  and especially to anyone who is dark-skinned.
24:03
So if they have to cast a Black girl as  a lead in a movie, more often than not,   they will cast a light-skinned actress because  they are perceived to be ""white adjacent.""
24:12
Example: The Hate U Give. I remember  being very upset when Amanda Stenberg   was cast in the role of Starr Carter  because Starr is a dark-skinned girl.
24:20
You see that in the descriptions  of herself, in the descriptions of   her mother and Uncle Carlos where she  singles them out as having light skin.
24:26
You see it on the fucking cover of the book. And, yet, this is who they cast. ""Scholars have noted that skin complexion  
24:33
is more consequential for Black  women's lives than Black men's. Intersectionality theory provides a lens through  
24:39
which we can understand how light  skin affords special advantages and opportunities to African American  women in ways that it does not for men.""
24:46
Hence, Thresh is allowed to be played  by a dark-skinned actor and Rue is not.
24:52
For a lot of filmmakers, biracial is the default  for Blackness. This is most evident with Netflix  
24:58
originals where any and all Black girl characters  are as light or lighter than a paper bag.
25:03
And, again, most of the time, this is with women. Because when you see Black male actors on  screen, a lot of the time, they are allowed  
25:10
to be dark-skinned. They're allowed to have Black  features and it's not made a big deal out of. You see this dichotomy with the  casting of Thresh and Rue respectively.
25:19
Thresh is described in the book as having the  same dark brown skin as Rue. For the movie,   Thresh was permitted to be played by  an actor matching this description  
25:27
while Rue was lightened for the  appeasement of white audiences. Funnily enough, one of the few  times in YA film adaptations  
25:35
that a biracial actor was cast as a  biracial character was for the film Everything, Everything.
25:41
And they still got it wrong! Maddy in Everything, Everything is half Black  and half Japanese but again Amandla Stenberg was  
25:49
given the part even though she is not Asian,  how do you guys keep getting this wrong?! It's a good time to talk about Thresh.
25:54
While there was some upset  about Thresh being Black,   you might have noticed that a lot of the vitriol  was directed towards Rue, towards Amandla.
26:03
As a character, Thresh keeps to himself,   keeps quiet and is known for his huge  stature that sees him towering over everyone.
26:10
It appeared to be more palatable to white  fans to see a Black man playing such a role. It’s evident that a good portion  of the vitriolic reactions to Rue’s  
26:18
“surprise” Blackness was that people  -- the racists -- literally could not   compute with the idea of Rue being this sweet,  innocent little girl and also being Black.
26:28
Katniss constantly compares Rue to her sister  Primrose. They both share flower names,   they're both twelve years old, they share  the same small stature and the same big eyes  
26:37
and the same innocence and Katniss wants to  do everything she can to protect them both. Every time Rue is described, Katniss  makes a note of her tiny figure.  
26:45
She’s so young and so tiny and so sweet. “Rue, who is dressed in a gossamer gown complete  with wings, flutters her way to Caesar. A hush  
26:54
falls over the crowd at the sight of this magical  wisp of a tribune. Caesar is very sweet with her,  
27:00
complimenting her seven in training,  an excellent score for one so small.” Some readers were wholly incapable of holding the  fact that she was Black along with the fact that  
27:08
she was so innocent and angelic. For certain  readers, it could only be one or the other. Perhaps most disheartening is the defense  that came to these young, prejudiced...
27:17
and frankly, stupid people. When they were rightfully called out  for being racist, the defense was:
27:23
""No, these kids aren't racist! They're using  racial slurs and implying that Black lives  
27:28
don't matter as much as white lives but they're  not being racist! Where'd you get that from?"" And it's like, dude...just call it what it is.
27:36
This one person on Reddit made a fantastic  point about bigoted readers and writers:
27:41
""I create my picture of them  based on their personality."" That's exactly the problem though. Even 'making  your own picture,' you defaulted to light skin,  
27:50
blonde hair and blue eyes for no reason at  all. It's good that you don't rage about   it like these people in the article but  deep-seeded white bias so prevalent in  
27:58
society is what's really disheartening  and kinda fucked up about it all."" And they were downvoted!
28:05
""Why are you booing me? I'm right!"" And that’s how you get people screaming  that Rue can’t be Black and now that she   is “suddenly” Black, her race detracts from her  innocence and now that she is “suddenly” Black,  
28:15
they can’t feel any sadness about her death. There are people who have argued that  the kids who tweeted those racist things  
28:21
weren't racist and meant no harm,  that they were just surprised. You don't need me to tell you that  surprised people don't just drop  
28:29
racist ideologies and slurs  when they're surprised. And if they do, it's because they're racist.
28:47
Some of the blame for this incident fell  on the shoulders of Suzanne Collins. The fans that were called out for their tweets  defended themselves by saying they thought  
28:56
dark/satiny brown skin meant olive skin.   And some insisted that it was easy to overlook  the description because it was ""too brief.""
29:04
As someone who has read all of  three books in my life time:   Slaughterhouse Five, Hunger  Games and What Would Keanu Do?,  
29:09
I feel safe in saying that most physical  descriptions of characters are short and sweet. The ones that aren't are either  Wattpad fiction or they're Moby Dick.
29:18
No in between. For the sake of this excuse  though, I decided to re-read   to determine how many descriptions  there are of, say, Peeta's Blond hair.
29:27
Because that had a lot of people fired up, right? I'm absolutely heartsick right now. So, I read the book and, by the  way, I did restrict it to just  
29:34
Book One because, I mean, Rue  only appears in Book One so I thought it'd be fair to just do the first  one. Maybe that doesn't make sense, I dunno.
29:42
And, uh, anyway, that description of Peeta  having blond hair, it shows up twice.
29:48
Do you know what else showed up twice?
30:05
Okay then, I thought, alright, how many times did they  describe Katniss, for instance, as having dark  
30:10
brown hair and olive toned skin? Because that's  something that a lot of people seem to remember   'cause they point it out all the fucking time.
30:18
And would you believe it? This vague and brief description shows up
30:23
once. So, Suzanne Collins established  that Peeta had blond hair twice.
30:28
She established that Gale and Katniss  had olive toned skin and dark hair once. And she established that Katniss'  mother and her sister Primrose  
30:37
had light eyes and light hair twice. And that is something  everyone seems to remember but   the fact that Rue and Thresh have dark brown skin
30:44
which was established twice and once respectively, technically three times if  we're counting the time it  
30:50
described Thresh because it was used  to describe Rue as well or whatever, no one could remember that.
30:55
Why is that? No, it's a rhetorical question. It's the racism. There's really no happy ending here. There's no  
31:03
moral, there's no way to tie it all up in a pretty  bow. It's just racism and racism tends to have no  
31:10
rhyme or reason. All you can say is  that this happened and it was awful. And that's it.
31:16
The question often posed in  light of this whole thing was, ""Well, where does it say  these characters are Black?""
31:23
And to be completely fair, the characters  of Rue and Thresh, as they are described,  
31:28
aren't necessarily Black. They were confirmed to   be Black by Suzanne Collins but they  could have been Indian, for instance.
31:34
What we know for sure, regardless, is  that they are definitely not white. The choice to base character descriptions  on skin color alone and not race means  
31:43
quite a few characters' races  become open to interpretation. So, ironically, because of that decision  to make whiteness neutral and the default,  
31:52
to make it the standard that goes  unsaid, I could ask the same question.
31:58

Infantilization and the Body Hair Debate,"1,930,899","140,000",8/14/21,35:40,"1:09
﻿So, I got Brazilian wax recently. [crickets] Oh, I’m sorry, how rude ah là là. Hey,  
1:15
how are you, my name is Shanspeare.  You look lovely in that shade   of...color. Anyways, I got Brazilian wax. I voluntarily drove  
1:23
to the nearest wax center in my area, climbed  up onto a table covered in that medical baking  
1:29
sheet paper, and I let a stranger dive headfirst  into my love portal and backdoor landing strip to  
1:34
remove every inch of hair. For $120 no less. I  think they have some sort of brainwashing thing  
1:41
going on because during the entirety of my wax, my  specialist kept talking about the cool, innovate,  
1:47
exclusive products they sell to maintain waxed  skin and when I go to the checkout area, I can  
1:53
just look for myself and choose whatever I want,  to which I of course decline in my head because  
2:00
I’m not falling for it--I got bills, baby!, except  the wax center is tiny, and all the products are  
2:05
on this one wall, right next to the cashier, and  there’s other people standing around you while   there’s a worldwide panny happening outside, so  you subconsciously try to scootch over into a more  
2:17
private bubble, which just so happens to be  against the products and I am telling you  
2:22
that your nose is practically pushed up against  it (through your mask of course). And they all  
2:27
look so pretty and shiny and new, and like a  human crow, you have just got to get one.
2:33
Except I got a bag full. And I am every  targeted ad creator’s wet dream.
2:38
The point is, I decided never to  get waxed ever again in my life. I   personally felt exposed, unlike myself,  and just totally wrong. So, naturally,  
2:47
I went ahead and booked another appointment. This whole ordeal really made me think: what is  
2:52
wrong with me? Why do I put myself through shaving  nicks and excruciating wax appointments, when I  
2:58
know I hate the aftermath of it once the second  or third week comes back around? Why do I feel  
3:04
like I need to be completely hairless in order  to be desirable--not only in person, but even  
3:10
in the minds of others? And what is with that  insistent nagging that this, like everything else,  
3:17
has something to do with societies growingly  unattainable expectations for women?
3:24
You know where this is going. About three weeks ago, I asked on   my community tab for video topic  suggestions relating to tropes and  
3:31
societal expectations. Esther wrote to  me, “This one may be a little too dark   but what I’ve noticed is that a lot of  people’s perceptions of femininity are  
3:39
tied to very predatory ideas and...wikipedia  files. I don’t know, is it just me?”
3:46
Well, Esther, I’ve got eight pages of source notes  here that confirm, no, it’s not just you.
3:51
PART ONE: HOLLYWOOD IT GIRLS,  LOLITA, AND INFANTILIZATION
3:58
Childlike innocence, virginity, and a weird  connection to sensuality walk into a bar.
4:03
Lana Del Rey walks in right  after it. Sorry. If you watched my 12 Going on 21 video, you  know there is a long history of mainstream  
4:12
media pushing the image of the sexy young girl,  which is quite frankly, the worst three words  
4:19
that I’ve ever put in succession.  Between teen and barely legal categories  
4:25
on...Corn sites, and an emphasis on sexualizing  teen characters on terribly written shows,  
4:30
a mark has definitely been left on our  collective perception of young girls. But none are so infamous and as  long-lasting as the 1955 novel,  
4:40
Lolita. Written by Vladimir Nabokov and narrated  by the Terrible Humbert, the plot follows the  
4:46
relationship between a middle aged man, that  being Humbert, and his 12 year old step-daughter,  
4:53
Dolores, or in his eyes, Lolita. Lolita is what  Humbert, a wikipedia file, calls a Nymphet:  
5:00
a sexually attractive girl or young woman. I say no other phenomenon has had as intense of an  
5:06
effect on pop culture as Lolita, because it quite  literally shaped many themes within pop culture  
5:12
itself. According to Ira Wells, “Nabokov’s novel  spawned two films, musical adaptations, ballets,  
5:19
stage adaptations...a Russian-language opera,  spin-off novels, bizarre fashion subcultures,  
5:25
and memorabilia that runs the gamut from  kitschy to creepy: from heart-shaped sunglasses  
5:30
to anatomically precise blow-up dolls. With the  possible exception of Gatsby, no twentieth-century  
5:36
American literary character penetrated the public  consciousness quite like Lolita...In the sixty  
5:42
years since she first appeared, Lolita transcended  her original textual instance: She became an  
5:48
archetype, an icon of youthful desirability.  Lolita became America’s sweetheart.”  
5:54
You can find references of Lolita across Lana  Del Rey’s discography and allusions to her in  
5:59
film classics like 1999’s American Beauty.  Somewhere between the late 50s and now,  
6:05
Lolita was refashioned from a victim of  terrible circumstances, to a sex icon.  
6:12
Even in the Stanley Kubrik adaptation of Nabokov’s  novel, Lolita is overs*xualized compared to how  
6:17
she actually was portrayed in the novel. “Nabokov  repeatedly emphasizes that there is nothing  
6:23
conventionally beautiful about the nymphet.  The novel’s Lolita is a tomboyish, malodorous  
6:29
little urchin: Humbert comments on her “monkeyish  nimbleness”; he duly notes every time she picks  
6:35
her nose or adjusts a wedgie. Kubrick, on the  other hand, airbrushes this character into a 1950s  
6:41
pin-up model. In her introductory shot, Lolita is  (un)dressed in a bikini, propped up on one arm,  
6:47
the posture and lighting carefully coordinated  to accentuate the womanly swell of her hips,   the smooth perfection of her long legs, her sultry  expression as she looks up to meet our gaze.”  
6:57
Awkwardly reminiscent of Riverdale, she’s  12. But, you know, in a “she’s actually 24  
7:03
years old with a Mortgage” kind of way. [Hi, I’m  editing, my head scarf is tied funny, I’m cold,   and this video comes out tomorrow even though  I filmed it today and I just want to say...  
7:13
it turns out Suellyn Lyon, the girl who  portrayed Lolita in Stanley Kubrick’s Lolita,  
7:18
was actually 14 at the time of filming  NOT an adult like I originally thought,  
7:24
so there is no such thing as a “womanly  swell of her hips” as Ira Wells puts it  
7:30
in the quote from earlier. I think the idea that the 1962 adaptation was sexualized is  
7:35
true, and the same goes for the 1997 version  with yet another teen actress playing Lolita,  
7:41
but we’ll get to the sexualization in a second.  I don’t feel comfortable describing children with   “womanly” adjectives because...they’re not women.  They’re children. And just to make things worse  
7:50
for everyone, Nabokov called Suellyn, a  minor at the time, the “perfect nymphet”  
7:57
which...ew.]   With that being said, I understand how framing  works and how the unreliable narration provided  
8:04
by Humbert plays a role in how Lolita is portrayed  in movie adaptations and the novel itself as a  
8:11
seductive sex icon, because…he’s a wikipedia file.  He’s not going to portray Lolita as a victim,  
8:17
because he doesn’t view her that way.  If he had morals, this wouldn’t even   be a discussion to begin with. But I do think it’s worth noting that,  
8:25
even when Nabokov made clear that Lolita  was not meant to be a romantic or hot novel,  
8:31
people still ran with that theme anyways, and  fashioned an entire movement after it. That,  
8:37
besties, is the point of contention, not really  the original novel or Nabokov himself.  
8:44
The blurring of childhood and promiscuous  adulthood portrayed within the Lolita  
8:49
archetype is heavily related to the media’s  portrayal of young women in general,   and celebrity young women especially. Britney Spears was 17 years old when she graced  
9:00
the cover of Rolling Stone, holding a Teletubby  teddy bear and pink cord telephone. These  
9:05
child-like, or perhaps more tween-like,  accessories were strangely paired with  
9:11
Britney’s shirt wide open, and Black  bra showing. The writer of her article,   Steven Daly, begins with this drabble: “Britney Spears extends a honeyed thigh across  
9:21
the length of the sofa, keeping one foot on the  floor as she does so. Her blond-streaked hair is  
9:26
piled high, exposing two little diamond earrings  on each ear lobe; her face is fully made-up,  
9:32
down to carefully applied lip liner. The BABY  PHAT logo of Spears' pink T-shirt is distended  
9:38
by her ample chest, and her silky white shorts —  with dark blue piping — cling snugly to her hips.  
9:45
She cocks her head and smiles receptively. But hold on. It's not like that.”  
9:53
Alicia Silverstone was 19 when her  Rolling Stone profile came out,   and that too featured a lot of child-like  wonder and a weird edge of promiscuity. Rich  
10:04
Cohen opens the article by stating,  “Alicia Silverstone is a kittenish   18-year-old movie star whom lots of men  want to sleep with.” Off to the roughest  
10:13
start imaginable. When Alicia shows the writer  a picture of her six year old self in a bikini,  
10:19
Cohen states that it “ brings to mind underground  rings and police sting operations.”  
10:25
[a deep profound silence  has entered the chat] The pictures Rolling Stone uses for her  profile are more of the same as Britney’s;  
10:34
a strange dependence on stereotypical “childish”  things, like stuffed plushies and images of her  
10:40
hair pulled back into ribbons as she blows a giant  bubblegum bubble; or her in lace bloomers, legs  
10:48
splayed open, while she holds a teddy bear. As Tavisha Sood puts it, “The portrayal of women  
10:54
in mainstream media has also exacerbated and  contributed to this infantilization of women.  
11:00
Since the 1970’s there has been a steady increase  in women and femininity being tied inextricably  
11:07
to fragility and infantility. In magazines, women  are often depicted in poses and or clothing that  
11:14
reaffirm the stereotypic beliefs of women  being vulnerable, weak and childlike.”
11:21
But there are many ways in which infantilization  is manifested, even amongst commoners like you and  
11:27
I. The infantilization shown in these pictures  and profiles of Hollywood’s young stars,  
11:34
can also be weaponized against older every-day  women outside of celebrity-ship.   Chelsae R. Huot, author of “Language  as a Social Reality: The Effects of  
11:44
the Infantilization of Women,” explains that  gender roles are placed on people as early as  
11:49
infancy, with newborn girls receiving gifts  that emphasize their proclivity for shopping,  
11:55
fashion, the color pink, and their insistence on  “Taking too long in the bathroom getting ready”  
12:01
like most older women are accused of. Newborn  boys, on the other hand, are perceived as just  
12:07
one-of-the-guys; all of his memorabilia is  painted with tough animals, like bears and lions;  
12:14
he loves the color blue and doesn’t care too  much about his appearance because he’s a guy  
12:20
and obviously, men don’t care about hygiene. These gender roles lead to a gendered society,  
12:26
where things are split down the middle  and handed off either to the feminine side   or the masculine side. Feminine people are seen  as submissive, receptive, loving, caring, etc.,  
12:38
and masculine people are seen as aggressive,  out of tune with their emotions, strong,  
12:44
and perfect for leadership roles. The ideal  of womanhood, then, is to be submissive,  
12:49
docile, nurturing, and small. While the ideal  of manhood is to be...John Cena, I guess.  
12:56
This gendered society with all of it’s gendered  rules creates a power dynamic between feminine  
13:02
and masculine people, especially with language.  Tavisha Sood correlates women in positions of  
13:08
power being called “girls” “missy” or “young lady”  by men in the workplace, with a man’s attempt to  
13:15
diminish, belittle, or infantilize her in order  to be perceived as the more dominant person. “His  
13:22
comment, made to subvert any claim of authority  she had, also branded the congresswoman as someone  
13:28
who doesn’t deserve her position. Painted as  a whiny child, this comment now has the domino  
13:33
effect of society perceiving her dominance for  arrogance and her demand for accountability as a  
13:38
tantrum. This subtle misreading of her actions is  how society starts to paint every ambitious woman  
13:44
as bitchy, letting women know that unless  they are docile or childlike, they aren’t  
13:50
the ideal mould of a feminine woman.” And yes, infantilization even crops up in popular  
13:57
culture and gender expectations surrounding  the infamous V-Card phenomenon. The concept  
14:02
of virginity has long terrorized our culture.  According to Wikipedia, the most dependable  
14:08
source on earth, the V-Card is oftentimes  tied to “cultural and religious traditions  
14:14
that place special value and significance on this  state, predominantly towards unmarried females,  
14:20
associated with notions of personal  purity, honor, and worth.”   In the media, and in real life too, but you  know, for the purpose of this video, the media;  
14:30
men who do not have sex are depicted as  losers, undesirable, awkward, and, uh,  
14:35
just Steve Carell, I guess. Women who do not  have sex are depicted as pure (or a prude), and  
14:41
oftentimes respectable. Madelain Holden, author  of “Do Men Prefer Virgins,” says on the matter,  
14:47
“Hence, we have a gendered (and heteronormative)  conception of virginity: It's embarrassing for  
14:52
men to be virgins and they should try to  have sex as soon as possible, but virginity   is a prize for women and the longer a girl  keeps her chaste state the more admirable she  
15:03
is...This is where the male fantasy element  supposedly comes into play: because virgins   are rare and precious, they're seen as the  ultimate sexual conquest for some men.”  
15:14
There’s even a fascination for brides, who are  expected to be virginal, with the whole white  
15:19
representing innocence and waiting till marriage  thing. Dr. Mark Griffiths, in his article titled  
15:25
“Virgin Fascination, states, ““Bride Fascination  is sometimes known as a V-card fascination, where  
15:32
the ideal woman is pure and uninitiated, making  her a safe partner in many ways. The bridal  
15:38
fascination extends to the image of an innocent  appearing V-card having bride being your own  
15:45
total...floozy.” I am trying really hard not  to get demonetized here “willing and anxious  
15:50
to do anything to please you sexually”. So, the V-card often correlates to innocence,  
15:56
that’s usually the driving point behind it’s  allure. Some men, a part of Madelain Holden’s   study of the V-card, even said that they don’t  actively seek virgins, because it feels morally  
16:06
wrong, as people who have their V-Card are  usually--but not always--young girls.   You see what I’m getting at, here? I was delirious by  
16:14
this point, entirely drunk off the idea that yet  again, I have made an intellectual connection.  
16:19
So I Googled “what are some child-like  qualities” and clicked on the first link   I saw because that’s the intellectual thing  to do.This Adult Life. Org cites ten things  
16:29
as being childlike qualities: “Being curious, Wanting to explore,   Having an imagination, Accepting others,  Having a sense of innocence, Giving generously,  
16:39
Being content, Freely expressing love Getting  up after a fall, and Being believers”  
16:44
I also searched up what it means  to be a feminine woman. Lisa Hart has a video on “how to become a siren  to seduce and hypnotize a high caliber man...”  
16:53
What is he, a gun? Which features advice that  states to angle your head down and look up,  
16:58
which makes men feel powerful and in need of  protecting you. Lisa says it’s a submissive   way of looking, and that it’s innocent. She  also says a higher pitched voice is feminine,  
17:08
but then again, she says the same thing about  a lower voice. This isn’t me picking on Lisa,   by the way, because I’ve gotta say, I think  she changed my life with the hip swaying walk  
17:20
tutorial. I have never felt more powerful. There’s also this 2020 Mind Fool graphic that  
17:25
boasts 10 tips on how to be more feminine and  sexy, including “taking care of your hygiene,  
17:31
dressing attractively, acting confident, smiling  more often, being receptive (which is the same  
17:38
word used to describe Britney from that Rolling  Stone article from earlier), being well groomed,   speaking softly, developing a right attitude,  being educated, and being an achiever.”
17:48
And, of course, the traits I mentioned earlier, of  women being perceived as loving, free flowing in  
17:53
their emotions, nurturing, submissive, etc. I thought it would be interesting to compare these  
17:59
two sets of traits and see how many we have that  are similar to each other. Receptive from the  
18:05
feminine side and accepting from the child-like  side are a two sides of the same coin to me;  
18:10
Innocence, obviously; being loving and  free in expressions are found in both;   and I would argue that in some cases, children are  expected to be submissive in the adult/child power  
18:22
dynamic. So, we can tally that up, as well. A lot of the articles I read that aimed to teach   me femininity, all emphasized a vague importance  on hygiene and grooming. While most of them didn’t  
18:31
bite the bullet, or the blade, so to speak, one  article was brave enough to explain what they mean  
18:37
by hygiene and grooming. And that is  the dreaded body hair debate.
18:42
Oh! That’s another similarity on the list!
18:50
This is a topic so lush and...a bit hairy--pun  not intended--that it deserves it’s own section.  
18:56
Body hair is a topic reserved for hushed  discussions between gals, as we chat (and  
19:02
sometimes lie) about what we do and do not get rid  of. Heather Widdows, professor of Global Ethics  
19:08
at the University of Birmingham and author of  “Body Hair is Natural. Society Thinking Otherwise  
19:14
is dangerous,” says that keeping your body hair  is seen as a political statement for women,  
19:19
to the point where celebrities who decide  to keep it (or, in Julia Robert’s case,   simply forget to shave) become entangled  in the news cycle for an eternity. They’re  
19:29
forever reminded of their hairy faux pas, and  branded unladylike until the end of time.
19:34
“It is the hairy body that stands out,” says  Widdows, “which is deemed abnormal and unnatural,  
19:40
even though hair grows on our bodies  every moment of our lives.” Oh, what was that? Oh, I’ve just been  informed that Veet has entered the chat.
19:49
In 2014, the hair removal brand, Veet, were in  a silly goofy mood. They released a commercial  
19:55
featuring a woman hailing a taxi cab, with her arm  up for obvious reasons, until she realizes the cab  
20:01
driver is looking at her funny from the other side  of his windshield. She looks down in confusion,  
20:07
and realizes her armpits are hairy. The camera  pans up, and we see that the woman has transformed  
20:13
into an even hairier man. She curses, and says,  “I shaved yesterday!” to which the cab driver  
20:19
drives off without picking her up. Because...sure. This commercial wasn’t the only one that Veet  produced about it’s weird body hair standards,  
20:29
and certainly wasn’t the only one that  faced immense backlash because of it.   In fact, Veet released a number of commercials  all with the same “Don’t Risk Dudeness” theme,  
20:39
where various women try to keep others from  realizing their body hair has grown back,  
20:44
and the ending is just them...being likened to  men. In one particularly interesting commercial,  
20:50
the camera zooms into a sunlit room, where  we see a man sleeping in bed. A hairy leg  
20:55
comes up from behind him and drapes across his  hip, and all seems fine until he touches it,   realizes it’s hairy, and a man pops up from  behind him saying, “I shaved yesterday!”
21:05
The implication here is that women have to get  rid of their body hair, of course using Veet  
21:10
because you know...it’s their commercial. Capitalism, you know? Or else those women risk being confused with men. Heather  
21:16
Widdows states, ““As the hairless body becomes the  only acceptable body, a dramatic shift happens.  
21:22
De-fluffing stops being a beauty practice,  and becomes redefined as a hygiene practice,  
21:28
as part of so-called “routine” maintenance.  Hair removal becomes something we have to do,  
21:34
a requirement. It is not an option to refuse.  It’s like teeth-cleaning, but without any  
21:40
of the health benefits.” People make a big deal about hair  
21:52
being unsanitary or unhygienic when it serves  the same purpose as eyelashes and nose hairs,  
21:58
and you don’t see people telling you to wax  those. Well, not the eyelashes, at least.
22:03
Carly Vandergriendt wrote an article for  Healthline, titled “What’s the Purpose of  
22:08
*Public Hair?”...Monetization, you know the drill.  which states, “Public hair   serves a protective function by trapping pathogens  that could otherwise enter your body. Removing  
22:18
public hair may therefore make a person more  susceptible to common infections, such as UTIs,  
22:24
yeast infections, and STI’s. Hair removal can also  irritate your skin, leading to skin infections  
22:30
such as cellulitis and folliculitis.” Mmm, so cool! But if public hair is so important to the safety  and protection of our most vulnerable region,  
22:40
why do we put such an emphasis on ripping  and clipping and snipping? And other synonyms  
22:46
ending in -ING? Especially when other countries  outside of the Western world, don’t put as much  
22:51
emphasis on body hair removal as we do--even  in the Ye Olde Lute days, Catholic women were  
22:56
expected to grow out their hair as a “display  of femininity.” It was kind of like that picture  
23:02
of those men riding their beards like bicycles  but…[laughs] The hair just comes from   under the robe instead [buh dum tss; this joke was  historically inaccurate]...Who said that?!
23:13
You’re not going to believe this, but it’s  not hard to figure out why removing body   hair became so important for women. You could  even say the selection...came naturally.
23:26
Marianna Cerini states that the culprit behind  body hair hysteria is the one and only Charles  
23:32
Darwin, coiner of natural selection and other  scientific things I didn’t pay attention to in   middle school. He associated a lack of body hair  with being “more evolved and sexually attractive,”  
23:43
and associated not shaving with “primitive  ancestry and an atavistic return to earlier,  
23:49
less developed forms.” For no reason at  all, I will now be showing you a picture   of Charles “body hair is primitive,”  Darwin, uh, with no ulterior motive.  
24:01
Hey, that’s a sick beard! Darwin’s views on body hair   caught on quickly. 19th century medical and  scientific experts began associating body  
24:10
hair with “sexual inversion, disease pathology,  lunacy, and criminal violence.” But just for women  
24:16
though! Just girly things, you know? Cerini states that “By the early 1900s,  
24:22
upper- and middle-class white America increasingly  saw smooth skin as a marker of femininity,  
24:27
and female body hair as disgusting, with its  removal offering ""a way to separate oneself from  
24:33
cruder people, lower class and immigrant,..  By 1964, 98% of American women aged 15 to  
24:40
44 were regularly shaving their legs.” But don’t get too ahead of yourself! Because  
24:45
removing body hair back then was nowhere near as  extreme as it is today. Cerini goes on to say,  
24:51
“In the late 1960s and 1970s, full bushes were not  at all uncommon, even in Playboy. Around that time  
24:57
you also had the second wave of feminism and the  spread of hippie culture, both of which rejected   hairless bodies. For a lot of women, body  hair was symbol of their fight for equality.  
25:07
It wasn't seen as unnatural -- not yet.” No, it didn’t become totally taboo until a shift  
25:14
occurred in pop culture, corn videos, and when new  techniques like waxing became popular. After that,  
25:20
hairless bodies became synonymous with  femininity, leading to such commercials like   Veet, which compares hairy women to men. I expounded all of that to get to this next  
25:31
sentence: that it’s kind of weird how we equate  hairlessness, especially in the public area,  
25:37
as ‘hot and desirable’--especially when the whole  reason that hair is there in the first place,   is because we went through puberty and are one  step closer to not being children anymore. I  
25:48
think that’s what hair signifies for me. In my  opinion. Hair is an indicator that I’m a grown  
25:53
woman. I think all of this makes me realize  that society has too long of a track-record  
25:59
of relating women to young girls,  and wanting them to look and behave   too much like children for my moral liking. And let me just step in and say that it doesn’t  
26:09
automatically make you a wikipedia file  because you like not having body hair or  
26:14
you prefer other people not having body hair.  That’s your prerogative. The problem comes   when you begin policing other people and even  yourself; when you say “you’re not feminine  
26:25
because you don’t shave or wax” or when you say  “other people have to be hairless or they’re not  
26:31
‘woman enough’ so I’m going to make  them wax and make them shave.” Just mind your business. Anyways, let’s get back on track.  
26:39
Between salivating over teen celebrities,  the nymphet aesthetic and Lolita obsession,  
26:45
to the similarities between child-like traits  and stereotypical feminine traits, it seems   like society has a perverse relationship with  women, almost fashioning them after children for  
26:57
whatever reason. And the idea that some people  prefer hairless, “innocent, V-card having”  
27:04
bodies does nothing to help this conclusion. That’s what I was going to end the video with, but  
27:09
that’s when I found out about tangents. I do think  it’s an interesting theory that the western world  
27:14
is infected with a sick case of the Wikipedia File  Disease, but it could also have something to do  
27:20
with our heternormative, male gaze-pandering  society….[widening smile]. Because, duh
27:26
And, for clarification, just because  I say the term male-gaze, doesn’t mean   women aren’t incapable of internalizing  and upholding heterosexist ideals too,  
27:36
which we will see later. The idea that women who  do not adhere to stereotypical gender roles (like  
27:42
shaving, submission, and etc.) was also a popular  retort for anti-feminists, who viewed feminism  
27:48
as an “ugly, aggressive woman” thing,  or a “womanless” thing entirely back  
27:53
during the first couple of waves. According to Breanne Fahs, a university   professor and author of “Dreaded Otherness:  Heteronormative Patrolling in Women’s Body  
28:02
Hair Rebellion,” the “Fear of being perceived as  the dreaded ‘other’--in particular, hairy, manly,  
28:08
angry, and lesbian--has long been the basis for  women’s shunning of the feminist movement.” We have essentially likened  feminism as the antithesis of  
28:17
“ideal womanhood” which we can definitely see with  previous revolutions and popular iconography of  
28:24
“ideal” women in the past. The unideal woman, the  feminist, is vulgar, manly, hairy, and a lesbian  
28:31
(which just won’t do in our society, because how  will men be satisfied by that?); feminists have  
28:37
historically been de-feminized because of their  perceived bitchiness/desire for “more” (in terms  
28:43
of rights). The ideal woman on the other hand is  hairless, feminine, polite, and a purveyor of male  
28:50
dominance. But why is that? Why does hairlessness  equal femininity? According to Fahs, “Hairiness  
28:56
connotes masculine qualities.” Remember when I  went on an on about gender roles? Yeah, hairiness  
29:02
fits in there too. “ Hair has historically  (at least in some contexts) represented power,  
29:07
so women’s routine hair removal symbolizes their  lack of such power.” Maybe that’s why women who  
29:12
are perceived as aggressive and domineering  are also painted as hairy and manly, because  
29:18
those are male traits to have. So they say. From there, “Women internalize ideas about their  
29:24
bodies as central to ‘proper’ femininity,”  states Fahs, “and become other-directed,   concerned about the male gaze, and oriented  toward the (heterosexual) dating market.  
29:34
Women learn to dislike or deny their bodies; hide  their menstration; women of color often adopt  
29:39
hair-straightening and skin lightening procedures;  poor minority women are often encouraged to pass as  
29:44
heterosexual to escape workplace discrimination,  violence, and negative judgements.   Women disguise and conceal their “natural” bodies  and undergo a vast array of bodily modifications,  
29:55
procedures, grooming habits, and maintenance  behaviors to conform to social norms.  
30:01
Embedded within such behaviors is the  insistence on the social maintenance of   heterosexuality--particularly  appearing heterosexual--and  
30:08
its accompanying body practices.” Fahs, who I mentioned being a university   professor, wanted to see this theory play out  in real life. So, they assigned an extra credit  
30:17
opportunity assignment for their class, and  anyone who wanted to participate would let   their body hair grow out and write a paper  about their experience. The results...Mm,  
30:29
let’s just say are a terrible  concoction of transphobia,   homophobia, and all around Human  Extinction Level Bigotry.
30:37
These are their stories.  [Law and Order Dun-Dun] “Bisexual and lesbian women who grew out their  body hair contronted issues of sexual identity  
30:46
disclosure and direct homophobia and heterosexism,  often prompting them to feel outed in public,  
30:51
less in control of identity disclosure, and  fearful about others’ negative responses   A student named Valeria said, ““Since I am an  open lesbian to only my friends and family,  
31:01
I think not shaving would give people another  reason to look at me weird. My mom would freak   out if I stopped shaving because she already  thinks that I want to be a guy. She doesn’t  
31:09
realize that being a lesbian and liking other  women doesn’t mean that I want to be a man.” A bisexual student named Mona states, “I have  never been a ‘girly girl’ by any means and one  
31:19
of my mom’s main hang-ups has always been that  I never really conformed to traditional female   roles. About a year ago, my mom found  out that I am a bisexual...This made her  
31:28
even more sensitive about my gender identity;  Upon [taking this study] many women that were   participating made the remark that someone  asked if they were turning into lesbians.  
31:36
I guess since my mom cannot be worried about me  being a lesbian, she just jumped to the next step   and asked me if this assignment was really just an  excuse because I wanted to get a sex change.”
31:45
A student who chose not to shave before the  assignment was even given, reflected on their   own experience with keeping their body hair: “A  group of the more popular girls followed me home  
31:54
after school calling me a [lesphobic slur] because  I hadn’t started shaving my legs yet, like all the  
31:59
other girls in my grade. I cried and asked my  mom that night to show me how to shave.” Beth states her brother associates body hair with  lesbian identity and ‘not getting a man. “He said  
32:09
that any woman with body hair certainly couldn’t  get a man, so I’d have to start dating women if  
32:14
I ever wanted to ever have sex.” Here, getting  a man represents the assigned goals of women’s  
32:19
body practices; rather than indicators  directed at women themselves--comfort,   confidence, and so on--attractiveness by male  standards stand as most important.”
32:29
And finally, Evelyn states, “I keep worrying that  it’s not just fun and games having body hair.   Maybe some guy at a bar will see my armpit  hair and think I’m a lesbian and he’ll round  
32:38
up a group of guys and attack me. I have heard  about it happening to women who are perceived as   [lesbian]. I’ve seen guys harass women who  don’t want anything to do with ","it took 13 hours to edit this.

I like Bo Burnham as much as the next guy, but the medium of musical  comedy inherently irks me. Putting a few jokes in your song
0:54
doesn't make me suddenly  enjoy listening to bad music. It's stand-up comedy diluted in  an ocean of amateur musicality,
1:00
like drinking flat warm watery 7UP out of a mug. Kind of music, kind of comedy. Cutting edge!
1:06
The worst of both worlds! And they're never satisfied with  just writing a funny song, are they? They're always like, ""and now...
1:13
""I'm going to make a point"". I can hear your defense of the medium already: ""CJ, you're only listening to the bad stuff! ""What about Tim Minchin and Tenacious D?""
1:19
Well they fucking suck too! The axis of awesome four chord song  has single-handedly fueled so much pompous reductive stupidity they  should be tried for war crimes!
1:27
Musical SNL monologues aren't funny. Why are we doing them? So the fact that despite this proclivity of  mine I yet vibe with Bo Burnham's work to the
1:35
extent that I do should demonstrate  my admiration for his artistry. Particularly his penchant for  stretching the medium of comedy,
1:41
ultra rehearsed theatrics, dense hyperactivity... It feels like home for me. - Pages are blank, I know it.
1:47
Why am I lying to you? And I do love stand-up. Comedy is one of the purest ways  to circumvent self-consciousness.
1:53
My affinity for offensive comedy is  rooted in its ability to reach into you and yank out authenticity in the form of laughter,
1:59
before you get a chance to make a judgment or decide how you're going to react. - Not once, not ever, ever
2:05
saw my dad hit my mother. I mean, he was quick
2:12
and you can't-- I don't get to decide if I laughed at that. It happened. - My brain said:
2:18
""Absolutely not, that is a big no-no. ""You're cancelled"". But my emotions said:
2:24
""That's kind of funny"". It shocks you into being you and not the  person watching themselves watching something! Burnham's work excels in inducing  the state of shock and authenticity.
2:32
- Me, with my strange choice of adjectives. You,

that reveals a hint of resentment for  it and the discourse surrounding it, it's because that's what I'm doing. I'd say it to his face and he'd agree with me!
3:25
- To summarize the show, though: Me. Me. Me! I'd also say this to his face:

immediately resulted in a decline  in his mental health yet again. He essentially did that thing where  you go on mood stabilizing medication

Now I'm going to talk about the 58 second  song about Jeff Bezos and nothing else. ♪ Jeffrey ♪ ♪ Jeffrey Bezos ♪
7:00
Part 1: Hysterical In Concept Alone The OP of an anime where the  protagonist is inexplicably Jeff Bezos.
7:06
A girl power bop for Lex Luthor. An inspirational anthem for Jeff on his quest for success.
7:11
Just in case, Bezos was feeling  a little unmotivated today. People are always criticizing the poor guy, let's send them some good vibes!
7:17
The implications contained in the mere conception  of this song are overwhelmingly comedically rich.
7:23
As a virus tears through the planet and Bezos's  net worth concurrently soars through the hundreds of billions, 95% of humanity buckling under  the financial strain of universal lockdowns
7:33
and governments vetoing livable stimulus checks, the digital age reaching what  feels like terminal velocity,
7:39
and Bo Burnham has one salient thought: Jeff Bezos needs a song to  commemorate his success.
7:45
Unenergy arises from the inscrutable intentions. In the best The 1975's song, ""Love It If We Made It"",
7:51
there are four lines about that Donald guy, the... The, uh... That guy that failed in the business world so  many times that he had to pivot his entire career.
7:59
♪ ""I moved on her like a bitch"" ♪ ♪ Excited to be indicted ♪ Although one could readily guess  the political leanings of Matt Healy
8:07
by looking at him for a sec, these four lines do not carry  an explicit political message. In fact, they carry no message at all.
8:13
They're inarguable, just factual statements. They're quotes, no judgment is passed. The power of these lines is that  we aren't told what to feel.
8:19
He just put reality on a  pedestal and pointed at it. The rest of the meaning is our responsibility. If Matt Healy singing ""I moved on her like a bitch"",
8:26
feels like a criticism of your  favorite failed businessman, it's because your bankrupt 70-year-old baby with the skin of a car seat
8:32
is a walking criticism of himself. The truth was so apparent it didn't require editorializing.
8:38
If reality is offensive to you, reality is the offensive part, not the person acknowledging reality. And don't take that out of context to be a TERF.
8:45
Instead of critiquing Jeff Bezos  in the system that created him, Burnham states facts and needlessly lends
8:50
a word of encouragement to the most  powerful human being on the planet. His motivational pep talk rings absolutely insane and unnecessary;
8:57
but, theoretically, for a supporter of Bezos, it should ring sincere and inspirational. He sidesteps direct commentary and, instead, simply describes
9:04
the momentum of Bezos's trajectory, which is ostensibly the American dream. What we're left with is an  uneditorialized representation of reality
9:11
and the feeling it ignites within us is our own reaction to the truth. Do we want Bezos to keep conquering?
9:16
Does he need us to be more supportive and in  awe of his monopolization of the global economy?
9:22
Is his work ethic and  ambition truly inspirational? Is this what you people who  defend billionaires want us to do?
9:28
Write anthems for our overlords? FUCK IT! You can do it, Bezos! BURN IT ALL! Part 2: Lyrical Analysis
9:35
Really weird you guys were just  listening to me talking about anything. That's just what the vibe is. The song opens with a mantra. A greek chorus chanting the inevitability of the hero's fate-
9:41
It's like the overture of 'Hades Town', or 'Hamilton or 'Hercules', or other musicals that start with ""H"".

10:08

10:14
The mantra repeats and a second voice joins in harmony. It bears repeating: ♪ CEO, entrepreneur ♪

10:26
that it practically begs to be understood beneath the surface. This isn't informative. It's chilling prophecy.
10:32

11:18
He operates within the law. He's created millions of jobs. And he's made all of our lives more convenient. His entire philosophy is giving people  what they want and making our lives better.
11:26
Amazon, ideologically, is obsessed with customer worship and they will tell you that! - Culture of customer obsession.
11:32
- Obsessive focus on customers. - Obsesses over our customers. - Totally obsessing over the customer experience.
11:39
- Customer obsession was our North Star. This technique and guiding principle  that Bezos clings to slavishly
11:45
is devastatingly effective. And it's crushingly effective across  the board in all sectors of commerce.
11:50
If Bezos even mentions there's an area that he's  interested in investing in, all of the competition in that field find their stock value plummeting
11:59
because it is assumed that  Bezos is going to destroy them. It doesn't matter what it is! He's done it before!
12:04
He'll do it again! What is this chest tightening sensation  that comes with this knowledge? What's wrong with Bezos being more powerful and successful
12:11
than, literally, everybody else? What's wrong with someone winning capitalism? In some respects, I agree staunchly  with Bezos's business principles.
12:19
He rejects the standard stock market  quarterly profit obsession in favor of commitment to quality and long-term ingenuity.
12:25
- When the stock is up 30% in a month, don't feel 30% smarter.
12:32
Because when the stock is down 30% in a month, it's not going to feel so good to feel 30% dumber.
12:39
Never spend any time thinking  about the daily stock price. - I don't. - Okay. I like that! I hate the fake numbers and the global gambling game of stonks.
12:47
I hate the analytics that YouTube and Spotify are constantly shoving down your throat against your will. Telling all this bullshit like, ""your percentage of growth today
12:55
""was lower than it was yesterday"". It doesn't fucking matter! My business and my artistry is not an algorithmic game
13:01
I'm playing with people's minds! My business is a good idea and good execution performing a service that people desire.
13:06
When you start focusing entirely  on quarterly profit increase and benefiting your shareholders moment to moment.
13:12
It necessarily makes you focus  on minutia instead of ensuring integrity of the big picture of your operation  admits natural fluctuations in the economy.
13:20
I'm not gonna argue with that, it's right! And it's what Bezos is doing, so what's wrong? Seeing someone win at capitalism is fucked!
13:27
Because it leaves us asking: ""Is capitalism the game we're supposed to be playing?"" We're born into this nightmare  where profit delineates value.
13:34
Our consent in this value judgment is manufactured and assumed, but we did make it and we're all sticking to it.
13:40
Humanity set the parameters for success, then we got our Übermensch. Here he is: Thanks, I hate it!

♪ Look at where you came from, look at you now ♪ When dunking on billionaires  and other successful people, a default fault that's easy to levy against  them is that they didn't earn their success.

- How I became a homeowner in my 20s: Cut back on sushi (I only eat it six days a week).
13:59
My father, the inventor of blood, wired me seven million dollars. Like that Donald man, who looks precisely like
14:04
I would draw a woodland troll with embarrassingly weak magical abilities. He likes to strut himself around like he
14:10
made something of himself and  he's talented in some capacity, but in actuality, he built his life  off of a loan of a million dollars,
14:17
which he then lost because he's bad at business! But Bezos was not born into wealth.
14:22
His parents were broke. And children! His dad was 19 and his mom was 17.
14:27
But a 17-year-old mom was a fucking hustler! She had to fight for her right to stay  in high school when she got pregnant,
14:33
because it was the 60s! And she won that fight and then she graduated with a-- Baby.
14:38
Then she did night school while raising Jeff, needless to say, these were challenging conditions to overcome. But, as a child, Jeff started modding electrical  appliances around his home of his own volition.
14:47
He graduated high school, was valedictorian. He graduated university with a 4.2 GPA.
14:52
Then he started working in telecommunications. Then he moved on to banking. Then he joined a hedge fund. Then he started Amazon.
14:58
Then he bought everything. And next he's gonna fuck off the space and buy everything there too! He did that thing we're supposed to do:
15:03
Work your way up! And he did it better than anybody has ever done it. So, naturally now, he controls everything. He deserves to, doesn't he?
15:10
He did it best. The problem here isn't Bezos, it's the system! Our manufactured consent to this value judgment.
15:18
Jeffrey is making clear what was veiled. He's showing us how to win at this game that we made.
15:24
Are we playing the right game? ♪ Zuckerberg and Gates and Buffet ♪ ♪ Amateurs can fucking suck it ♪
15:30
Bezos is demonstrably richer than Bill Gates, Warren Buffet and Mark Zuckerberg. But the deeper more philosophical distinguishing  factor that sets Bezos apart from those three
15:38
is that he's bald. I'm kidding, that's not it. Bezos once penned a memo to his shareholders codifying 24 rules of ""corporate coolness"".
15:46
In it he lists things that are and are not cool: ""Young is cool"". ""Polite is cool"". ""Authenticity is cool"".
15:52
""The unexpected is cool"". ""Rudeness is not cool"": ""Pandering to the crowd is not cool"".
15:57
""Conquerors are not cool"". What: Is this? Why did Bezos feel the need to write these words?
16:03
Why is this information inside his brain? Why do you think it was pertinent  to share with shareholders? The answer to this question  is exceedingly important.
16:11
This is the most powerful  fucking bald dude that exists. As Bezos puts it in the memo:
16:17
If corporations are cool, customers invite them into their private spaces. And that's exactly where Bezos is:
16:24
In all of our homes. He's listening and tailoring our experience  to the finest point of our desires. - And I think Jeff really embraced that.
16:32
That idea that, ""hey, if you have data, ""ultimately, you win"". And you out here just doing  your best to start a business.
16:38
Amateurs can fucking suck it! ♪ Fuck their wives, drink their blood ♪ ♪ Come on, Jeff, get 'em! ♪ I don't think most people fully  understand what Amazon is.
16:46
It began as an online bookstore in 1994. That's before I was born. That's before 9/11.
16:52
That's before the Internet as we know it! Bezos clocked the dormant energy in the Internet  while everyone else was still skeptical of it.
16:58
His business plan for Amazon  was extremely specific: Open a book shop online. Relieved from the constraints of physical reality,
17:05
your online store can have a wider selection  than any in-person store could ever hold. Commit to running the business at a loss for years,
17:12
pricing your books lower than all other stores. The combination of the price superior  range of selection and convenience
17:17
of being able to purchase from your home  and have it delivered to your doorstep will eventually make you the only  logical choice as a book retailer.
17:23
So, of course, Amazon slowly  grew to cover the entire country. And, of course, it started to slowly  destroy the book retailer business
17:31
because no one could compete. But Bezos is a businessman. He doesn't want to just see  businesses fail left and right,
17:37
he has empathy! So we approach the other retailers with a solution: Keep your store, keep all of your sales,
17:43
AND sell online. We already built the infrastructure, just give us a tiny cut and you can gain access to this  new audience that we're addressing.
17:51
Your business still exists like normal and you gain access to the online  sphere that we've created.
17:57
We take a little bit of a cut  from every time you sell a book, but you're selling books to the new premier customer base for books!
18:04
Instead of killing off his competition, he's bringing them with him! And the other retailers conceded-- My back hurts so bad, goddammit.
18:10
They started selling their books through Amazon and through Amazon they made more money, more profits. Sold more units than they had in years.
18:15
- Our attitude toward Amazon was, you know, render unto Caesar,
18:21
and that which is Caesars. And then carry on as best you can. [CJ] As Amazon's delivery system  grew more and more sophisticated,
18:29
Bezos started selling hundreds of  other products in addition to books. And he approached every other retailer  in the country with the same proposition:
18:35
Use our system. Sell online in the biggest online  marketplace there is in existence. But,
18:41
do you understand what's happening? Amazon isn't just selling its own products, it's taxing any product that gains to be sold online.
18:49
And there's no fucking point in creating  an alternative method to sell things online because Bezos already did it perfectly.
18:55
He's already dominating, why would you invest the money  to try to compete with it when inevitably they're just going to  defeat you and you'll have lost at all?
19:03
There's no point! Just start a different business and sell your shit partially through Amazon! For those of you that believe a free market is the
19:08
best way to ensure people work  hard and get what they deserve, t's not a free market if a dude owns the market!
19:15
Amazon has created jobs, made our lives more convenient, made a lot of people money, saved a lot of people money. Now, with Prime Video, they're financing films.
19:22
They made Audible, so you can hear books. And they made the Kindle, in case you still remember how to read them. They own Twitch, so by extension, the entire streaming industry.
19:29
They're breaking into the  prescription drug industry. They bought whole foods, so they can revolutionize grocery shopping next. And, of course, in all of Amazon services,
19:36
they're recording every second that  you're interacting with their software, so they can use that data to optimize  the usefulness of their product for you.
19:44
They're extracting data from every moment of your relationship with every  single product that they create, and they're using that data to make your  experience the best it could possibly be.
19:52
And the only thing they ask for in return is  their unquestioned dominance over all commerce. Ah!

I transcribed the song. Look, I did the whole thing. It was easy! Yeah, that's Musescore, not Sibelius.

Maybe I'm a broke bitch. Maybe open source software is the best way to advance humanity and technology in an altruistic collaborative fashion.

Maybe I'll kill your firstborn with a wrench! I'll stab you with a gun. I'll shoot you with a sword. I'll kill you with a gun that shoots swords.
20:21
The harmony of Bo Burnham's one minute song titled ""Bezos I' is uncomplicated. Alternating E minor and D major triads
20:27
add color to a furious bass  line of even 16th notes. The aesthetic is that of a  gay nightclub in the 80s.
20:32
It sounds like Tears for Fears and it makes me want to do cocaine. There's a classic adage in music theater: ""When movement isn't enough, you dance, when speaking isn't enough, you sing"".
20:40
After setting the stage of Bezos's life, and then encouraging Bezos, and learning from Bezos, and cheering Bezos on...
20:47
Eventually, Burnham becomes overwhelmed by the momentum of Bezos's destiny, and then he lets out a battle cry in celebration of his conquering of everything!
20:55
♪ Come on, Jeff, get 'em! ♪ This battle cry unlocks a blistering synth solo. When singing is not enough, you scream,
21:02
and when screaming is not enough, you rip a fat lick! The solo consists, primarily, of one motif repeated ad nauseum.
21:08
The motif goes: 4 - 5b - 4 - 5 - 1 in the key of E minor. So: A - Bb - A - G - E
21:14
That Bb at the top is deciding A LOT about the tone of the solo. In the key of E minor, Bb is not  necessitated by the key signature,
21:21
it's a decision. The effect of which is immediately  apparent as Bb is the blue note of G,
21:26
which is the relative major of E minor, so it functions similarly in both cases. ♪ ♪
21:33
That's the blue note. ♪ ♪ Don't be intimidated by music theory, is just names for noises you already know.
21:39
Burnham hammers this repetitive bluesy motif into us again, and again, and again, and again. [ Plays Solo ]
21:45
It's another stylistic property of the  blues to really sit in a lick for a while. The blues is said to speak to the human soul, like ""Little Else"" does.
21:53
It's an expression that came out of working class, sentiment and sorrow. And it's about leaning into those sensations.
21:59
So the emotion derived from this blues  lick that Burnham is leaning so heavily into is that it's something in his  heart that really needs to get out!
22:05
[ ""Bezos I"" Solo Playing ] Burnham repeats the motif identically three times in a row and then, finally, he departs from that to play an F# altered scale.
22:14
[ Continue Playing Solo ] The altered scale, also known as ""super-Locrian""
22:19
is the seventh mode of the melodic minor scale and is a famously uncomfortable and unstable sound. Every note is technically fair game within the key,
22:27
but it still feels very disconcerting to listen to. This dissonant scale in combination with the childish rhythm it's played in
22:33
really inspires a sense of unease. But it only rears its head for a second and then Burnham is back in his blues motif.
22:38
[ Continue Playing Solo ] It loops as though it will never end.
22:44
It starts to rush ahead of itself and fall apart, and then we get one beat of Bo screaming and that's the end of the song. ♪ ♪
22:51
[ Screams ] - I don't know about you, guys. It all comes across so desperate, like the solo is dragging Burnham
22:56
behind a chain to offender. It's inevitable. It's basking in its own glory. It's repeating and it's compressing and it's speeding up and it won't stop
23:03
and Bo is dragged along with it, whether or not he likes it, and he screams because he doesn't know what else to do. [ Screams ] It makes me laugh every time.
23:09
Part 4: What's Bothering Bo? In anticipation of writing about this song, to refresh myself on the context from once it was born,
23:16
I watched everything that Bo Burnham's ever created. Four times. Burnham has filmed four full hour comedy specials,
23:22
produced a TV show and directed a feature film. His career started when he achieved virality accidentally at the age of  16 with bad musical comedy.
23:29
He managed to leverage the online  attention into a real-life stand-up career and was the youngest person to ever obtain--
23:34
Obtain? OBTAIN? He managed to leverage the online  attention into real life successl starting in stand-up and becoming the
23:41
youngest person to ever SECURE a  30-minute Comedy Central special, at just 19 years old. When I was 19, I was doing three grams of molly per weekend
23:48
and going thousands of dollars in a debt. How do they do it? He recorded his first full hour  comedy special a year later,
23:54
titled 'Words Words Words'. 'Words' is fine-- I don't like it, okay? I don't like it. It contains most of the stuff he seems to be
24:00
apologizing for on the song  ""Problematic"" from 'Inside'. I imagine he would cringe through a viewing. It was 2010. Comedy was edgy, fill in the blanks.
24:08
The songs are bad and he goes full  lyrical spiritual miracle multiple times, which is another white person rap music faux pas.
24:13
♪ To relax my mind ♪ ♪ I take a walk by the clock and I pass the time ♪ His talent is still obvious and  it's still hyper creative and funny.
24:19
But I don't like the songs and there's a lot of racy 2010 stuff that wouldn't slide today and I'm not going to show it, because he was a kid, oh, my God, let him grow up!
24:25
2010 was a different fucking playing field! I was in the eighth grade working on a LEGO Star Wars stop-motion YouTube channel!
24:32
And one of the videos that I  scripted very passionately got 3.5 million views!
24:37
We were children! There's almost definitely some racism in there, somewhere! I do remember our stereotypical Asian accent was  offered gleefully from our beloved Asian friend,
24:46
and then the stereotypical gay accent was by me, so I think that we were skirting by on a technicality.
24:51
- Holy Versace Leather! YouTube was a wasteland of a website. No reaction videos,
24:57
no video essays, no makeup tutorials. God knows, no Jimmy Fallon lip sync battles!
25:02
Channel Awesome didn't exist 10 years ago. Let alone Lindsay Ellis. It was just Smosh and nine year olds  throwing spaghetti at a chalkboard,
25:08
unaware they were pending the tour of modernity. Bo Burnham wrote a silly song in  his junior year of high school,
25:14
uploaded it to YouTube in 2006, so he could send it to his brother easily, and then 10 million people ate it like a deer carcass!
25:21
And you know what that teenager did? He responded to the positive attention  slathered on his impressionable mind via an
25:27
unprecedented means of mass communication and he wrote more silly songs to share  with his new strange kind of audience.
25:32
And he's talented and he's funny and people smiled. So why am I rolling my eyes when he dares to try to inject meaning
25:39
into the medium that we damned him to as a child? By the way, nobody better come for me  for being hard on Burnham and his work.
25:45
Wanna know why? 'Cause he told me to! - My fans, they stick with me through everything, through thick and thin.
25:50
Do not stick with me, through thick. If I stop entertaining you, throw me to the curb. He's actually the only person who  enforces the performance audience divide
25:57
consciously with outright  hostility as much as I do! - I love you! - No, you fucking don't!
26:03
I appreciate it It simply is what it is. Some really good jokes that I love.
26:08
Some musical comedy which I am... Burnham himself seems to not totally love his ""now I'm going to make a point"" moment.
26:15
- If you have a line in there that is-- If you can live without an audience, you should do it.
26:22
- The liner say to give you  what he cannot give himself. - I had felt like I had really  exhausted myself as a subject.
26:30
Like, truly. I mean, I was like, so tired of my head. Like, just, you know, I mean truly.
26:36
Like, I didn't like expressing myself through myself anymore. And we got 'Eighth Grade' out of it too, great movie.
26:41
And we got an amazing run of interviews that  Bo Burnham did to promote 'Eighth Grade', where he's trying to stick to his  rehearsed talk show friendly anecdotes,
26:49
but is constantly losing his temper and going on rants about capitalism and big tech. It's exceedingly satisfying!
26:54
- We're applying a like, capitalist, whatever, like... Streamlining logic to literally our emotions and our souls!
27:02
Comrade Bo! - Like, the Internet was the super-- The internet super highway where it's like, libraries are everywhere.
27:08
And now it's literally our well-being. Wait, what? - Our attention is being colonized until there will be none left.

We're getting into- Is how I sound like? - No. - Yeah, it is. [ Laughs ] In late 2015, a video uploaded to Vine by  two girls from North Carolina went viral.
0:22
The video showed the two girls dancing to Fetty  Wap's newly released single ""Jimmy Choos"".
0:27
It's ""Jimmy Choo"", not ""Jimmy Choos"". Even though, they come in a pair, but it's Jimmy-- You know what? So Fetty had released his  song on November 5th, 2015,
0:35
and Vine was actually at the height  of its popularity around that time. In December of that same year it  had amassed over 200 million users.
0:45
For those of you that don't know, Vine was TikTok before TikTok was TikTok, except it was more sketches and stuff and way shorter,
0:51
like you had five seconds to go viral, literally. Now, back in 2015, we weren't doing challenges as much as we are now.
0:59
And by ""challenges"", I mean ""dance challenges"", but this video sort of created a  challenge to Fetty Wap's ""Jimmy Choo""
1:08
with fellow Vine users recreating the girls dance  in random gas stations throughout the country.
1:14
It always seemed to be at a gas station. Y'all are committed to the details, I appreciate that. But this video isn't about the challenge,
1:20
it's about the section of the song  those girls chose to highlight.

But before we get all vulnerable and educational, let's give a shout out to our sponsor. Y'all, it is becoming more important,
Shouts to Squarespace
4:14
now more than ever, I would say, for all of us to develop an online presence.
4:20
A lot of y'all be messaging  me about how to get started, how to get started if you don't have  social media and all this other stuff,
4:26
and while I do think you need to have social media and if you want to amass some sort of audience on the Internet...
4:32
If you're reluctant to do that, building a website is the next best thing and that's where Squarespace comes in, y'all.
4:37
They got you from a personal website, to online stores, to marketing, to analytics...

4:57
opera days was with Squarespace and I was  doing it actually for a school assignment,
5:03
but I got a really good mark on that one, because the guy was like, ""oh, my God, this looks so professional!"" And I was like, ""oh, my God, thank you!
5:08
""I did it myself with Squarespace!"" And the discount code that a podcast  had offered, you know what I'm saying? So head to squarespace.com/khadijambowe

Part 1 What is Slim-Thick?
5:40
So BuzzFeed actually has a really  great introductory video about different types of ideal women's  bodies throughout history
5:47
and throughout different regions. Honestly, they focus on like, dynasties and global superpowers,
5:53
but if you want to learn about that, I will link the video below. Starts from about ancient Egypt and continues on to today.
6:02
So the basic theme that I noticed with these  ideal women's body types throughout history
6:08
and another video that I watched pointed this out, I'm going to put it here because  I forgot the YouTuber's name. I'm so terrible!
6:14
But there seems to be this fluctuation between skinny body types and bigger ones. So like, the skinny ones are like, the boyish figures of the 1920s flapper Era
6:26
and then, the 60s mod Era, kind of reminiscent of adolescence and the 90s heroin chic Era bleeding into the early 2000s,
6:35
which was still kind of heroin chic, but with like, slightly tanned skin and real long torsos,
6:40
like we loved a long torso in the early 2000s. It seems like there's that end of the  spectrum and then there's the curvier aspect
6:49
and those are like, women of the Victorian Era, Victorian England. There are the Hollywood starlets from the 40s and 50s.
6:56
And our present era of slim thick Instagram bodies, which seems to be an amalgamation  of a few of these ideal body types.
7:07
So, according to Urban Dictionary, we love our Urban Dictionary definitions, the slim thick body is:
7:13
""A girl with a slim body shape but a big booty and big thighs. ""Usually with a small waist and flat stomach"".
7:20
Now, a lot of people's bodies  are naturally shaped this way with the exception of the super flat  almost concave stomach and side gap,
7:29
but we'll talk about surgery more in a bit. The slim thick body type has been popular  in a lot of racialized communities of color,
7:36
particularly racialized  black and brown communities. I grew up in the south, in Georgia, and I was always tall and skinny
7:43
and got made fun of for not  having enough meat on my bones, and especially for not having an ass.
7:49
Like, you cannot have an ass in Georgia, it's just... At least not in a racialized black community, it's just not a good look.
7:56
When I went back to the Gambia, where my family's from, in 2017, I'd gained, I'd say, probably like,
8:01
20 or so pounds since the  last time I'd been there. All of a sudden, I had a body now, everyone was like, [ Speaks in Wolof ]
8:08
Which is basically, ""oh, you've got body now"". All of my aunts and stuff would either compliment or say something.
8:15
Like, my mom hadn't seen me  in a while, so she was like: ""Oh, look at you! You finally have a butt now! ""Remember when Khadija didn't have a butt?""
8:25
But that's something that I've  always just grown up around and I think a lot of you that  watch these videos have, you know,
8:31
you walk into a relative's house and if you're socialized as a girl, the first thing they ask you or talk to you about
8:38
is your weight and if you have a boyfriend. It's like-- Those topics go hand in hand.
8:44
But it's like, you can't go to a family  gathering without those two subjects. And maybe what you're doing in school.
8:50
That's probably the last question. Anyway! When I was talking about the ideal body type,
8:56
woman's body type throughout history, not all of them, as we know, but a good portion of them
9:01
were through a racialized white Western lens. And the difference is:
9:07
You have the original slim thick body and the influencer slim thick body. Those are the distinctions I'm gonna make.
9:13
Because the original slim thick body type, belly fat, no thigh gap and all has been a body type
9:20
celebrated in racialized black and brown communities for a long time. Even when it wasn't the ""ideal woman's body type"" in the present
9:35
Whereas the influencer slim thick body type is the new iteration.
9:40
Comes with some new tweaks and some new adjustments that aren't typically found in nature.
9:46
[ Laughs ] It's the best way I can describe that and we have two groups of women to thank for this distinction.
9:54
Or, as examples of this distinction:
Part 2 Kardashians and Video Vixens
10:02
So, I talked about this in my Video Vixen... Video. But the typical body type of the late 90s  early 2000s Video Vixen was exactly this.
10:11
It was medium to large breast, a small waist, an ass you could bounce a quarter off of...
10:17
You know, it was either, figure eight or a pair. An extreme pair.
10:23
Those are like the two body types or some mixture of the two. Think Melyssa Ford, think Buffie the Body,
10:29
as a couple of examples. Google, you disrespected Buffie the Body, because when Maddie was trying to figure out who this was,
10:36
all that came up was Buffy the Vampire Slayer. And I know we stan Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but still!
10:42
How are you're gonna disrespect Buffie the Body like that? These women, as far as I know, naturally had these types of bodies.
10:49
Probably paired with some diet and exercise. Maddie did point out that, in the late 90s early 2000s boob jobs  were the thing that people were getting,
10:57
so maybe a good portion of them had boob jobs, but I don't think, and this is not fact,
11:03
but I'm not thinking that a lot of them  had butt implants and surgeries done,
11:08
as far as I know. Yes, even back then, this body type seemed unattainable, but it still felt realistic.
11:15
Their bellies were mostly flat still, but there was a bit of a softness to them. Their boobs were sometimes altered, but I don't know if it was necessarily the norm.
11:24
Their thighs had no gaps, since carrying a booty of a certain size requires thighs and hips that can really carry that weight, you know?
11:33
I am sure, even if I'm talking about  how ""natural their bodies were""-- I'm sure that some of these women
11:38
got cosmetic procedures and body  modifications and all that, for sure. But it didn't seem-- A grain of salt,
11:45
because I was like eight or nine during this time. But it didn't seem like it  was as pervasive as it is now.
11:51
But another group of women  would help to change that. They're the ones who gave us  the influencer slim thick body.
11:59
Is this like media culture critic? Like now I've come up with terms we have the original slim thick and the influencer slim thick or the instagram slim thick?
12:07
Comment below! So I've talked about the Kardashians on this channel before! Some folks accused me of  being a hater and, honestly,
12:16
some of y'all take YouTube videos too seriously. Like, I know there's a seriousness  about sharing your opinion online,
12:23
but sometimes y'all... Some of it's not that deep. In 2007, the Kardashians were introduced  to us via their hit reality show,
12:32
'Keeping Up with the Kardashians'. Before that, the family's main  celebrity at the time, Kim, was a celebrity stylist, closet organizer
12:40
and sidekick to the OG influencer, miss Paris Hilton.
12:45
- Can I get a picture with you? - Steve, come here. Can you take a picture of me?
12:56
When Paris was ruling Hollywood nightlife, the size double zero body was all the rage,
13:02
with those super long torsos and those really tiny bags. Kind of like, right now, but a bit different. Like women's pants were getting lower and lower to show off their flat stomachs
13:11
and protruding pelvic bones. It was interesting. What an interesting time. No one with a slim thick body type had a chance of making it
13:19
as a famous celebrity socialite or model, unless they were shaking  their ass at a Jay Z video,
13:24
and even then, mainstream success wasn't likely, unless you already had it like, I'm thinking about Beyonce.
13:30
She's always had this sort of slim thick body type, but she was a bit smaller back then, so it wasn't as like ""boom"", you know?
13:37
Even J.Lo, people have always  talked about J.Lo's ass, but J.Lo is still quite slim.
13:42
So yeah, it's not to say that  women that had this body type never got any celebrity or anything at that time,
13:48
it's just that it wasn't the  ideal standard at the time.
13:54
But then, Kim K and Ray J let the world see Kim's famous derriere in action.
14:00
Allegedly. And I'm just saying ""allegedly"" because we can't say that, either one of those two people released it, or knew that it was about to be released,
14:08
and I'm not trying to get sued, so... Taking notes from Paris, because Paris Hilton also had a  famous sex tape leak and that's...
14:15
What a lot of people credit to her fame, even though she was super young when it happened, it was dating someone was very old and it's a very sketchy situation
14:22
and I don't know why we were at-- You know what? Different time! Taking notes, though, from Paris, Kim quickly surpassed her skitty blonde  bestie in terms of celebrity and relevance
14:32
and her booty gave her a little extra nudge. As Kim Kardashian was becoming more famous,
14:38
her butt was honestly the talk of the town. Interviewers were always asking if it was real, if they could touch it, all that sort of stuff.
14:44
She even, on an episode of 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians' filmed herself at a doctor's office getting an x-ray to prove that
14:50
there was nothing in her butt, to put the rumors to rest. - What brings you in today? - This is a really crazy request.
14:56
My sisters have dared me to get a butt x-ray, because there are so many rumors that I have butt implants.
15:04
- Mmm-hmmm. - And I'm so tired of them. So I really just want to get like, a butt x-ray.
15:09
So I can show the whole world-- This was in 2011. So, as Kim's celebrity began to rise, as her sister's celebrity began to rise,
15:17
as they, allegedly, started to dabble in cosmetics, a new version of the slim  thick body began to emerge.
15:25
This one, the influencer slim thick or Instagram slim thick body,
15:31
involved thigh gaps-- Not all the time, but a lot of the time. The flattest of flat, flat,  flat, flat, flat stomachs!
15:40
And a big old ass! Damn, too much booty in the pan! Now, the reason I kept leaning towards  words like, ""natural"" and ""organic""
15:47
is because I think it's important to  stress that the slim thick ""upgrade""
15:53
is not common in nature. It's not found in nature. As far as I know. And if it, is it's a very  small percentage of people.
15:59
100%, there are people who naturally have this type of body, or they work out, so they can create this type of shape,
16:07
with the way that they work out. Like, you can body sculpt and all those things, and eat different types of food to get that, for sure!
16:13
But a good majority of the girls on  Instagram, and TikTok, and stuff, were not born with these assets.
16:20
Ladies, some of you just weren't. And that's okay! But baby, this is America! And Canada.
16:26
Lands of opportunity! Lands of freedom! Lands whose founding principles still hold true!
16:33
If you don't have it, you can get it. As long as you have money. Even if you don't have money.
16:39
If you have access to credit, you can get-- You know what? Okay.
Part 3 The rise of the BBL
16:47
So, when I was in Phoenix, visiting my partner, we went to Scottsdale mall, which is, apparently, a like--
16:54
Scottsdale is just apparently  a very affluent area, but she kept pointing out all  these people that had BBL's.
17:00
Now, I knew the slim thick body type, the influencer slim thick body type was rampant on the Internet,
17:06
but I've spent a lot of time really  trying to curate my Instagram feed, so that I have all sorts of body types, all kinds of people,
17:14
just as many different types of  bodies that I can see all day, because I think that's important. Like, the Internet isn't going to do for you, you have to do that work yourself.
17:22
So, I've honestly think I've been kind of  naive to how popular this trend has gotten,
17:28
but seeing how many YouTubers have made  videos about BBL's and all this sort of stuff, I thought it would be kind of fun  to learn about it the history of it,
17:35
and, yeah, so... Let's talk about the BBL, where did it come from? Where we get her from?
17:40
So the BBL or Brazilian Butt Lift, is a cosmetic procedure that uses liposuction and/or fat grafting  to change the shape of your body.
17:50
Specifically your hips, waist and, of course, your booty. Booty, booty, booty, rocking everywhere!
17:56
If you have body fat in parts  of your stomach and lower back, the fat can be removed with liposuction and placed
18:03
in your butt and hips to give  you a more voluptuous shape. If you don't have enough fat in your body, you'd get a fat graft,
18:11
and, apparently, only up to 80% of grafted fat survives in the body, so patients who do this option end up having to follow up with more procedures,
18:20
some more surgery to maintain their new physiques. That is all I can confidently say  about the procedure of the BBL,
18:27
because I think watching videos with  surgeons actually explaining this procedure and/or reading articles with surgeons  explaining it is your best bet.
18:37
Sources will be below, yes. So, cosmetic surgery or plastic surgery is actually not a super new concept.
18:45
I mean, doctors are performing breast  augmentations as early as the late 1800s, but...
18:50
[ Laughing ] Butt. When did surgeons stop looking at  boobs and start looking at booties? Booty, booty, booty, rocking everywhere!
18:57
Well, according to Day's Beauty, Brazilian plastic surgeon, Ivo Pitanguy
19:04
Dr. P is credited for being the creator of the Brazilian butt lift,
19:09
back in the 1960s, with innovations to the procedure happening over the preceding decades, of course.
19:15
In 1964, Dr. P published a paper on-- You know what? No, that's not fair.
19:21
- Ivo Pitanguy. - Ivo Pitanguy All right, y'all, sorry. I had to BRB for a second,
19:26
so that I could actually  pronounce his name correctly, because I need to put respect on someone's name. So, in 1964 Dr. Ivo Pitanguy--
19:34
I might have gotten that still wrong, but I think that's right. Published a paper on early butt lift surgery. Early butt lifts revolved in moving  skin and tissue to ""correct sagging"",
19:44
but, at the time, there wasn't a way  to transfer the fat that was removed and use it in other areas to increase volume.
19:51
Like I mentioned before, in the decades that followed, you had innovations to the  procedure here and there. You even had the first butt implant surgery  being performed by a Dr. RJ Bartels in 1969,
20:03
but the rise of liposuction in the 1980s is what really helped shape this new method of body contouring.
20:10
There's a lot of like, puns and stuff in this script.
20:16
Using fat removed from the body via  liposuction and re-injecting it into other parts of the body became popular in the 90s,
20:23
after Sydney Coleman a plastic surgeon from New York City, published a series of paper outlining a standardized practice
20:31
for this complicated procedure. And the rest, as they say, was herstory. Now, BBL's may not have been super popular  during the heroin chic Era aesthetic of the 90s,
20:42
but as we got into the late 2000s and early 2010s, the big booty fantasy was on the rise.
20:48
Thanks in part to changing  beauty standards, as always, and, of course, celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Nicki Minaj, you know...
20:55
Now we see the BBL's... Aren't going away anytime soon and are quickly becoming
21:01
the fastest growing cosmetic procedure in the United States. According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons,
21:08
the amount of BBL's jumped from just 8,500 people in 2012, to over 20,000 in 2017.
21:16
Also according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, in 2015, some type of butt related procedure was performed every 30 minutes.
21:26
This is all types, not just BBL's. But clearly we've been obsessed with  the BBL for like, the last decade or so.
21:32
A plastic surgery office in Pittsburgh dubbed 2014 ""the year of the rear"".
21:38
What can I say? We love our booties. But is all of the shaping necessary? More importantly, is it safe?
21:45
So, I don't want to rain on anyone's parade, but we gotta talk about the potential  dangers of this cosmetic procedure.
21:51
Before we get into the benefits and all that stuff, because it's important. And yes, I will be fair and talk about the possible benefits,
21:58
because everything has good and bad, and we're talking about individual people, you know?
22:04
So, well, and society. So the bad about this one is that, according to an Urgent Press release,
22:10
put out by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons in 2018, up to one in 3,000 people actually die from BBL procedures every year.
22:19
They called it an ""alarming rate of mortality"". It's not clear if it's including  American board certified surgeons
22:27
and people going to like, DR to get it or random places, where maybe they're certified in other specialties, but not that.
22:34
But, either way, no matter where you're going, no matter how specialized they are, no matter who the surgeon is in any part of the world,
22:42
no matter their level of expertise, there are still risks. One of the main risks associated with  the BBL procedure besides that stat about
22:50
D E A D that I read you, is the risk of fat embolisms. Let me see if I can explain this well.
22:55
If not, there are going to be  articles below that you can read. Basically, if a surgeon hits a blood vessel  where they're re-injecting the fat into,
23:05
which is easy to do, because butts have high volumes of blood vessels, it can actually get into your bloodstream, go into your heart and
23:13
KILL YOU. So that's not great. The other not necessarily risk,
23:19
but thing to consider about the BBL procedure is recovery time. Surgery isn't some cute little thing you do to your body,
23:26
even if it's cosmetic. It's a traumatic event to the body. Not me thinking I know so much  about surgery after watching
23:33
'Grey's Anatomy' repeatedly for the last decade. But it is something traumatic to the body!
23:38
And your body needs time to recover. And with BBL's, some doctors say you can't sit on your butt
23:44
or lie on your back for a minimum of three weeks after the surgery. Either way because this operation  is still relatively new,
23:51
because the 1960s weren't that long ago, it seems like there are kinks that doctors all over the world
23:58
are still trying to sort out, especially because this operation has become so popular. And lots of other potential risks just have to do with your individual medical history.
24:07
If you're someone who's prone to blood clots, surgery of any kind can be risky, but BBL's...
24:12
Maybe you might want to rethink that. Now you're probably wondering: ""If people do their research, see how risky it is,
24:18
""then why would they still want to get the surgery?"" The biggest benefit that I saw in videos of  people who spoke about their BBL's was confidence.
24:26
It seems like, for people, it can be a life-changing confidence booster. Like, any cosmetic procedure.
24:31
And, in terms of how your clothes fit, how your bathing suits look, how your pictures pop off on Instagram,
24:37
it can also be that extra boost in confidence one might need. - It has been two months since my Brazilian butt lift
24:43
and I have been loving every second of it. The whole liposuction just really shaped me really pretty, I think.
24:49
It's very feminine and kind of sexy. I feel ecstatic, I feel happy,
24:54
I feel anxious to show off my results. I feel like this is the body I was supposed to have.
25:00
It fits with the rest of me. It fits with my family... And just fits with everything I want to do in my life.
25:06
There's also a benefit that a lot of  people don't consider when it comes to BBL, specifically on racialized black and brown bodies.
25:14
In Shamika Sanders, Hello Beautiful article, from earlier this year, Sanders notes: ""Black women's bodies have always been  associated with curvy and full figures.
25:23
""It's something, as black women, we learn at a very early age. ""Whether we fit the 'ideal' body mold or not,
25:29
""the way our bodies are shaped has been  conversation-starters since Sarah Baartman. ""And today is no different,
25:35
""especially when you log on  Twitter and see BBL's trending"". In this article, Sanders recalled  this viral tweet I'll show it here,
25:43
from Twitter user @MuvaofGotti... Mother of [ ], damn!
25:50
You see how when everything's matched together? I read that...
25:55
@MuvaofGotti. Okay. This article goes on to show how some racialized black women
26:00
on Twitter were defending these women  that were all going to DR to get the BBL. ""It's so annoying watching people bend over  backwards to criticize women who get BBL's,
26:09
""like we haven't been sensationalizing  having a fat ass all their life, ""like their desire to get a  BBL just came out of thin air.
26:17
""It's all this 'love your body' after the fact. ""Let's be fair"". ""They shame Coi Leray for being skinny,
26:24
""Megan Thee Stallion for being tall and strong, ""Saweetie for plastic surgery, ""and Lizzo for having fat.
26:31
""I'm starting to think there's no right  way to occupy a body when you're a woman"". ""No, let's talk about it.
26:37
""So BBL's are dangerous ""and women shouldn't be putting their lives  at risk to achieve a beauty standard, right?
26:42
""But what do y'all do to bodies that  aren't conventionally attractive? ""Go on. ""Tell the class"".
26:48
These ladies are right. It's impossible to be socialized as a woman in this world and keep up with the ideal body type,
26:54
or beauty standard of the day. Especially when the Internet has us  going through these trends at warp speed.
27:01
And I know that's mostly for like, fashion trends, but who's to say it won't move from clothes and onto our bodies.
27:07
Especially with how pervasive and  normalized plastic surgery is becoming. Particularly, if you roll in  circles of people that have money.
27:13
Women who occupy racialized black and brown bodies are SUPPOSED to have slim thick figures.
27:20
It's ""natural"". And if you're a racialized black or brown woman that doesn't, everybody will let you know.
27:25
If you decide to get a BBL to change all of that, everyone will turn around and clown you for it. Some of y'all need to think before you tweet,
27:31
and that's why I'm not doing Twitter. I just won't. Side note, but it still kind of fits: In 2019, 'Code Switch', a podcast that I talk
27:38
a lot about on this channel, did an episode about how common ED's are becoming
27:43
in racialized black and brown communities, because of how obsessed our relatives are with our bodies.
27:49
Highly recommend y'all, check it out linked below.
Part 3.5 Plastic Surgery (What's the big deal?)
27:56
So, in researching this video, I had to start asking myself to evaluate  my relationship to plastic surgery.
28:04
To the point where I was like, ""maybe it isn't so bad"". Like, it's pervasive in society, but maybe that's not a bad thing.
28:09
And that's kind of hard for me to say out loud, because I'm not sure if t's what I really think, or if I'm just super impressionable and...
28:18
Because plastic surgery is so common, or because it's so common now, maybe I've been conditioned into not looking at--
28:25
As it, as such a bad ideal anymore, such a big deal? I don't know. It honestly is probably a combination of the two,
28:31
because I believe in bodily autonomy and think adults should be able to do whatever they want with their bodies.
28:37
Booty, booty, booty, rocking everywhere! However, ""yet and still"", I can't help but wonder how younger people feel about all of this.
28:45
Being an influencer is  becoming a legit line of work. I think The Take talked about how influencers  are like a burgeoning new professional class.
28:53
With that new line of work class-- Whatever you want to call it., there are expectations about  how you're supposed to look.
29:00
If you're... I don't know, under the age of 25, let's say, and all of a sudden you're wealthy and famous,
29:06
what's an operation here? A little tweak there? Remember tweakments, from my Instagram face video?
29:12
What's the big deal about a few tweakments here or there? If it's all going towards solidifying your staying power?
29:19
Because that's what being an influencer is, at the end of the day. Trying to stay as relevant as possible. And if this body type is the most in...
29:28
You do the math. And while I don't think that BBL's  are an epidemic amongst teenagers,
29:33
because I doubt that random doctors are like, ""yeah, I'll give you a BBL"", to like, a 15 year old,
29:39
like I don't think that's what's happening-- Oh, no. I can't help but feel for our nieces, nephews and niblings, you know?
29:45
Especially those that are on TikTok, because those BBL post-recovery posts
29:50
were trending for a while and according to Centennial Beauty, teens and children make up the  majority of active TikTok users.
29:58
With Statistica estimating that 25% of TikTok's  US user base is in the under 19 age group.
30:06
When I was growing up-- I know I say that like I'm 80. I'm 29. But, when I was growing up, the Internet was around,
30:11
but things like Instagram didn't exist. Instagram became popular when I was out of high school,
30:16
in my late teens and early 20s. So, yes. I was still having more access than I needed to like,
30:22
friends and family and stuff, but the early days of Instagram were nothing like they are now.
30:27
We were all using very questionable filters, probably the same ones from  'RuPaul's Drag Race' Season One.
30:34
And wearing high-waist pants. So people's body altercations...
30:39
Al... Al... Altercations. I'm saying ""altercations"" like it's a fight, but I mean when you alter a clothing item.
30:45
Altercations? Altercations. Alterations.
30:50
I swear I know English! But those body modifications weren't as accessible as they are now!
30:57
And I mean ""accessible"" in terms of, you weren't seeing them on your  Instagram feed as much as you are now.
31:02
And now it's time for me to confess. Because this may surprise some of you, but when I was in my early 20s,
Part 4 Plastic Surgery Confessions
31:11
I heavily considered getting a boob job. I didn't talk about it to many people, if any;
31:16
but it was something I was seriously considering. I would look at my boobs in mirrors and think, ""okay, if I was just like,
31:23
""one cup size bigger, I'd be happier"". Because I'm kind of in the in-between  of like, a pear and an hourglass shape,
31:30
though I say I'm more of a pear shape. But I thought, ""if my boobs  were just a little bit bigger, ""I'd be an hourglass"".
31:36
And then I thought that, if my boobs are bigger, it would make my waist look smaller and it would just even out,
31:43
compared to how big my hips are and stuff. Like, I genuinely was like, trying to do that kind of math in my head.
31:49
This was back in 2012-2013, so right when the Instagram influencer  slim thick body type was on the rise.
31:57
The main inspiration, though, for my boob job wasn't a Kardashian or miss Onika Maraj.
32:04
It was actually Kelly Rowland. So I found out she had gotten her boobs done
32:09
and they didn't seem excessive or look unnatural, and I was like, ""oh, cute! ""Okay, maybe I could do something like that!""

"make more characters bi, you cowards: why (not) romance?","8,217",,8/28/21,51:16,"0:00
hello void and all who inhabit it, it's  me and [snap] i'm ready to get demonetized
0:15
['Canada' by Pictures of a Floating World] We are back with another installment to the  romance and media series but today I wanted  
0:22
to flip the question and instead ask why not  have romance? I'm planning a whole video on how  
0:28
romance in film and TV is lackluster in general,  but, similar to the original main question,  
0:35
I thought it'd be interesting to break this down  in parts. And today we're starting with bisexual   characters: how their being bi is often erased and  flattened and why there in turn needs to be more,  
0:46
better written bisexual characters. Two quick  things before we get started - first when I say  
0:52
bisexual, bi or bi plus I'm referencing anyone  who experiences attraction to multiple genders  
0:58
and anyone who is not monosexual. This is  no disrespect to any of the MOGAI labels  
1:04
that exist out there, but I agree  with the Bisexual Resource Center   that “calling bisexual or bi plus an umbrella  term and pointing out the difference between  
1:14
personal and political labels is not to force  anyone to call themselves bi or even bi plus.  
1:20
Instead it's to point out that even if  we have different labels for ourselves,   we are facing many of the same disparities  and challenges as non-monosexual individuals.”  
1:30
I will also be using queer in a reclaimed way now  and then. Two, this is going to be another binary  
1:37
heavy video. There are not a lot of non-binary  characters in film and TV and even fewer that  
1:45
are bi so I didn't feel comfortable making as many  hyper focused generalizations of those characters  
1:52
in the way they are depicted, but if you have  any insight on any non-binary characters even  
1:58
ones not in film... even ones yeah not in film or  TV feel free to share with the class down below.
what are we working with here?
2:07
[“Tell Me” by Ryan Little] For the past 25 years, GLAAD  has tracked the number of LGBTQ  
2:16
recurring and regular characters in  television series. And for the past 16,   they have released a yearly report that includes  suggestions on ways to improve representation.  
2:27
For the 2020-2021 television series, GLAAD found  that 28 percent of LGBTQ characters on screen  
2:36
identify as bi plus. Of the 99 bi plus  characters recorded, there were 65 women,  
2:43
33 men and one non-binary person, which was a  decline from the 90 women, 36 men and two binary  
2:51
people from last year. The decrease was expected  given, you know, the panty raid but even the  
2:57
all-time high of LGBTQ representation that was  the 2019-2020 television season saw a decrease  
3:06
in the percentage of bi rep to 26 percent. More  important than the shifting numbers is the fact  
3:13
that bi representation hovering around the mid-20s  is far from the reality that 54 percent of the  
3:20
LGBTQ community identifies as bi. Bi characters  have had and still have a long way to go  
3:28
not just in terms of quantity but also quality.  Thematically bisexuality has long been connected  
3:35
to metaphors about being confused or trapped  between two worlds or greedy or duplicitous  
3:42
and it's not just that a lot of bi characters  are morally dubious but that, as Hannah J.  
3:48
Johnson writes, “most bisexual characters  are defined primarily bi their orientation  
3:55
and as a result any immoral acts they commit are  connected with bisexuality itself.” Depictions of  
4:03
bi characters are changing but the shallow ghosts  of the past still loom quite close to the present.
4:10
The introduction of the Hays Code is the  foundation for a lot of terrible queer   coding that persists today but the AIDS crisis  in the 80s led to a mainstream vilification of  
4:22
bi men specifically as dangerous, lying  carriers of disease, both in and out of  
4:28
fictional media. The connotation of bi  men as untrustworthy is less vile today  
4:34
but a lot of people still invest energy into  doubting bi men's attraction to women. There's the  
4:42
concept of “bi for now,” the idea that this man  is actually gay just let him sit at 350 degrees  
4:49
until fully attracted to men or golden brown. As  a result bi men often show up in TV storylines  
4:56
where a straight woman fears that she has picked  the wrong guy. Bisexual men's difficulty in dating  
5:02
women also shows that, along with homophobia  and serophobia, bi men have to contend with  
5:08
not being perceived as masculine enough. I  want us to focus on this idea of masculinity  
5:15
because our depictions and understanding of  male sexuality are often inextricably linked to  
5:22
how masculine we perceive this man and what we  consider masculinity to even be in the moment.  
5:29
In movies and TV, a lot of our ideas of what a  strong masculine main male character should be  
5:36
are pulled from the Byronic hero trope. A TL;DR  of Byronic heroes is that they are charismatic,  
5:43
passionate about their beliefs, intelligent  and rebellious but also cynical, moody,  
5:49
brooding and probably have a dark past. While  traditional Byronic heroes fit more into the  
5:55
anti-hero bag, a lot of modern male protagonists,  hero and anti-hero alike, pull from this trope,  
6:03
which is really interesting because Byron was  a good old-fashioned 18th century bisexual  
6:09
and most often these characters are not. Even  if we step away from a biological criticism lens  
6:16
and just look at the initial creations, we see a  character type that has warped greatly over time.  
6:23
In their paper ""I Unsex'd My Dress"": Lord Byron's  Seduction of Gender in ""The Corsair"", ""Lara"", and  
6:30
""Don Juan,"" Alexis Spiceland Lee writes that Byron  “characterizes his heroes in ways that challenged  
6:38
gender normativity and that highlight individuals  struggle for subjectivity in the face of cultural  
6:44
forces. His continuing engagement with this  character type suggests that his experimentation  
6:50
with differing modes and styles of masculinity  is part of an exploration of gender as it is  
6:56
figured into his culture, as well as part  of a larger philosophical debate on gender,  
7:01
love, and sexual liberty.” These characters  didn't just brood about their individual dilemmas  
7:07
but processed said dilemmas through storylines  that questioned larger societal expectations,  
7:13
especially ones with regards to masculinity. What  is missed in modern distillations of the Byronic  
7:20
hero trope is a similar exploration of gender  and culture norms. Prime example: a familiar  
7:27
trait of toxic masculinity is that men are not  allowed to show physical affection for each other  
7:33
outside of very specific contexts. Straight  men have been social distancing before it  
7:39
was a public health mandate. As a result, our  main male character, although Byronic adjacent,  
7:45
has to be incapable of physically interacting with  any other man, beyond violence usually, in order  
7:51
to maintain the veneer of painful heterosexuality.  These men are crafted from a character type that  
7:57
struggles internally and externally but instead  of processing conflicting desires or alternate  
8:03
modes of masculinity, their stories are stripped  of intimacy in order to hone in on a singular form  
8:10
of manhood: one which doesn't allow any form of  exploration. Take for example Jon Snow. Now to  
8:19
be honest, can I be honest girl? The only episode  of Game of Thrones I've seen from beginning to end  
8:24
is the series finale, so I'm not an expert here.  But my friend recently watched the whole series  
8:31
and they so graciously sent an audio message  that raises some really interesting points.  
8:37
When I started Game of Thrones knowing the ending  I thought it was so ridiculous. Because Jon Snow,  
8:42
aka the like main protagonist even though  they don't they pretend he's not at, first um  
8:49
all he wanted to do at the beginning of the show  was go to The Wall, where there's like a band of  
8:55
brothers who you know like all you know protect  the realm or whatever. But basically he - his  
9:00
whole goal this entire series was go to the  sausage fest and I thought he never made it   there - no! In fact he makes it there. He has  whole arcs with all of his boyfriends there.  
9:09
And then he comes back to the main plot and then  they end up having to banish him back to The Wall.  
9:15
But at the wall he immediately gets really close  with the nerdy kid there, of course it's like a  
9:20
chubbier kid named Sam because it's just like Lord  of the Rings. Anyway he and sam are constantly  
9:25
made fun of for being gay even though they're not  but also they're very sweet friends. Then he also  
9:31
makes - there's like five best friends that he  makes there, and of course they all slowly die   off. But um then also when he goes beyond The  Wall to meet with all the like wild people um  
9:43
he brings back this really giant um red-haired  dude - the Tormund guy, who's hilarious. And  
9:48
he and Tormund are very very uh gentle with each  other. Like they make gruff jokes but also Tormund  
9:56
will always be like “Jon Snow is prettier than  any girl I've ever seen” and stuff like that.   So anyway at the end, he goes back to The Wall  with Tormund and I don't know they just seem like  
10:07
they're - they're partnered for life in some way  or another. Also to be clear Tormund is the one  
10:14
who seems the most sexually fluid just because  he -when they go beyond The Wall and they're  
10:19
like saying something about “oh there's no girls  here,” he said, “we'll make do hahaha” and no one   said anything. So anyway, all this to say if not  Sam at least Tormund was Jon Snow's boyfriend.
10:31
Jon Snow's affection for his male friends,  Tormund's comments and behaviors towards people  
10:36
of different genders, they aren't really followed  through or seen as more than opportunities for  
10:41
jokes. Layer on top that Game of Thrones killed  most, if not all, of its queer characters and we  
10:48
get in Jon Snow specifically, a duty-bound pillar  of masculinity who has to move away from his  
10:55
snow boyfriends and into the bed of his aunt in  order to maintain that image. Now wait a minute,  
11:01
Game of Thrones killed off a lot of people,  not just the queer characters. Absolutely,   you are correct. But I think it's interesting that  the character continuously upheld as the hero to  
11:13
root for isn't made bi, despite opportunity to  do so. In addition to the kind of masculinity  
11:20
Jon represents, I wonder how much his sexuality  is connected to the need to have him live until  
11:27
the end and how that could clash with the show's  trend of removing most of its queer characters  
11:33
expeditiously. Another example is James Bond,  specifically the version played by Daniel Craig.  
11:40
Besides the fact that all the gay-coded  characters in Bond films tend to be evil,  
11:45
Bond being bi would undermine his appeal  as a man's man. Even though he would - you  
11:51
know like literally - anyway! Bond is charming and  skilled and intelligent. He drops into a location,  
12:01
f-cks a woman with a provocative  name before completing his mission,   and dips. Adding other genders to Bond’s  list of potential one mission stands doesn't  
12:11
negate any of his other skills or traits but his  ability to pick up and discard women like tissue  
12:18
is so woven into his performance of masculinity  that hinting at any other possibility had people  
12:26
shaking in their rat boots, foaming at the mouth  to deny it. Bi male characters that do exist are  
12:33
often limited to a specific archetype that we'll  talk about in just a few moments but the brooding  
12:39
hero? Our dashing, but not bumbling, lothario? He  has to be straight - or else. Now making these men  
12:47
bi isn't the only way to explore different forms  of masculinity, but it's the one we're talking  
12:53
about today because the potential for sexual  fluidity among men is especially restricted.
13:00
Women on the other hand are more likely to  be bisexual in film and TV, often confirmed  
13:06
via that familiar lighting technique we're all so  fond of, but bi women also have a long history of  
13:13
being hyper-sexualized. Johnson also reflects  that while there may be more bi women on TV,  
13:20
“female bisexuality is only accepted under the  condition that it exists to fulfill the desires of  
13:26
men and this conditional acceptance is not a form  of privilege but a form of oppression.” Although  
13:34
Johnson's article is from the not so distant  past of 2016, I wouldn't say the situation is  
13:40
as dire now. While we still often do get the sex  driven bi woman as a major form of representation,  
13:47
we have seen a lean away from the male gaze.  These women, confident in their desires,  
13:53
are not performing for men's sexual fantasies.  Two tropes come to mind that feel like a direct  
13:58
response to the image of the loose, wild, and  free bi woman crafted by and for the male gaze.  
14:05
The first being the bi femme fatale: a woman  with a strong handle on her sex appeal but in  
14:11
a threatening way. She is unable or uninterested  in utilizing damsel in distress energy to lure  
14:17
you in but she's still captivating. I wrote this  bit before finding a copy of Shiri Eisner's book,  
14:24
but in “Bi: Notes for a Bisexual Revolution”  Eisner writes about the bi femme fatale at length,  
14:31
stating that such a character poses a threat  because it's “unclear if she is loyal to the   patriarchy or not.” Eisner is speaking more to an  antagonistic bi femme fatale, but her examination  
14:43
draws focus to said characters duplicity and  knowledge of both sides as a source of unease.  
14:51
Similarly to bi men, a fear of untrustworthy  behavior drives the role and story of many  
14:58
bi women characters. Modern bi femme fatales  I think showcase similar traits, but just  
15:05
framed positively by making this woman a main  or supporting character who we were rooting for  
15:11
instead of a villain who we want to see removed.  Secondly, there is the super capable badass,  
15:17
and maybe in this is the experimentation  of gender that I was looking for as these   women get to be more aggressive, which  is a stereotypically masculine trait.  
15:27
Very much not about the bullsh-t, these women  do nothing, let alone hypersexualize themselves,  
15:32
for the consumption of men. This portrayal in  particular matches up with the trend of fluidity  
15:38
in women being more widely accepted. Masculinity  in women as well, to a specific extent, is allowed  
15:47
and seen as desirable. I think this can also lead  to a desire to distance these bi women from their  
15:54
relationships or potential relationships with  men, but, again, we'll get to that later. The  
15:59
point here is that bi women characters have a long  history of hypersexualization to grapple with and  
16:05
improved representation shows attempts to subvert  or reject that history. As for bisexual lighting,  
16:13
it's pretty. But if there's no attempt to explore  or own this character's bisexuality in the story  
16:20
in a meaningful way then it's just pretty and  sometimes that's not enough. Amelia Perrin  
16:28
for Cosmo wrote, “regardless of the setting,  portraying bisexual people in neon lighting in  
16:34
general (which we can't help but associate with  clubs and dance floors) only further reduces us  
16:40
to our stereotypes. The implication is that  bisexual hookups and relationships are merely  
16:46
experiments and something that only happens when  you are on a drunk night out.” Now I don't think  
16:52
it is inherently negative to portray bisexual  people living it up, but bisexuality in women  
16:58
is often presented as this intense burst of  eye-catching behavior, that, similarly to neon  
17:05
lighting, is reserved for specific occasions.  This is not an everyday thing. And although not  
17:11
every bi character is presented through a pride  flag tinted lens, Perrin was onto something by  
17:18
pointing out the frequency at which bisexuality  is connected to nightlife, neon, and nefarious  
17:24
behavior. Which brings us, quite clumsily,  to the magical hedonistic bisexual trope.
magical hedonistic bisexual trope
17:31
Please support your local gender witch and check  out Verily Bitchie’s channel. They have a lot of   dope content on bisexual history and bisexuality  in media specifically. In one such dope, and  
17:43
rather brief, video, they talked about the magical  hedonistic bisexual trope. Obligatory disclaimer:  
17:50
tropes are not inherently bad. It is the repeated  production of a limited set of images in relation  
17:57
to a trait or traits that can be bad but every  genre has tropes. That's how you know you are  
18:04
watching a romance versus an action adventure  movie. Arguably the magical hedonistic bisexual  
18:11
is heading towards overproduction-ville,  but it's still a better depiction than  
18:17
older negative images of bi people. So then, what  is the trope? In their video, Verily separates  
18:24
“magical” from “hedonistic,” the magical aspect is  often literal while the hedonistic indulgence is  
18:31
self-explanatory, but they also point out how and  where the two traits can overlap. The resulting  
18:38
magical hedonistic bisexual is “counterculture;  they do not adhere to monosexual rules of  
18:45
mainstream culture or don't understand it.  Their bisexuality goes hand in hand with power,”  
18:51
and again sometimes this is literal. And “they  flourish in their otherness as an expression of  
18:57
their beauty and goodness.” These characters stick  out, comfortably so, and that is, if anything,  
19:03
to their benefit. Notably for this conversation,  hedonism impacts how these characters approach  
19:09
sex. It's incredibly easy to find scenes with our  bisexual of choice in the aftermath of a threesome  
19:16
or flirting with multiple people. The hedonist  doesn't allow room for question because you will   definitely see them living lavish, flourishing in  their command of others. I wonder if what makes  
19:27
viewers reluctant to read certain characters  as bi is that they aren't over indulgent,  
19:33
while other characters can be pinned as bi before  it is confirmed because they are. From this angle  
19:40
the reluctance to read a character as bi is  also influenced bi the long-lingering biphobia  
19:46
that has told us all that bisexuals are selfish  and impulsive. The result is not wanting those  
19:54
negative traits, along with bisexuality,  connected to a character who you like.
19:59
Sidebar: I feel like a lot of times bisexuals  are placed in threesomes, triads, and throuples,  
20:04
either in canon or in fandom, because  of this depiction of bisexual hedonism  
20:10
via sex combining with seemingly an inability  to understand bisexuality unless you see  
20:18
someone actively flirting or engaging with two  people of different genders at the same time.  
20:25
It's not that depictions of bi poly people are  bad but all bisexuals are not polyamorous - and  
20:33
likewise all poly people aren't bi. But if the  only depictions we are getting of bi characters  
20:40
is as - not even really poly, because you know  there's an argument to be made there that that's  
20:45
not being portrayed realistically - but more  so as these modern day worshipers of Dionysus,  
20:52
that can be negatively limiting. Not  just because of the focus on hedonism,   but because it can underscore the negative  stereotypes of bisexual people as incapable  
21:02
of being satisfied in a relationship or happy  with being partnered with just one person.  
21:08
The impact of that is both external, influencing  perceptions of bi people, and internal,  
21:15
fueling bi self-doubt. Laura Crone did a video  recently on Thor: Ragnarok, funnily enough,  
21:21
and in it she talks about the bi angst  that comes from feeling you have to prove   your sexuality through dating or sleeping  with multiple people of different genders.  
21:32
Part of this bi angst is fueled by depictions of  bi characters as people on an insatiable quest  
21:39
to f-ck all around the world ei yi yi. That's not  an attraction model that interests every bi plus  
21:45
person, but a lot of us hold ourselves to this  standard that we could and should be doing more,  
21:51
pursuing more people. And like, if no one has  told you yet today, I'm here to let you know  
21:57
that being in a monogamous relationship  does not negate someone's bisexuality.
22:03
All that being said, I do think that the magical  hedonistic bisexual trope, that's a mouthful,  
22:10
does provide potential to diverge from stereotypes  that all bisexual people are hypersexual and  
22:17
greedy in that these characters’ indulgence can be  seen as revelry and an embrace of their otherness,  
22:25
instead of an uncontrolled overconsumption  of other people. While we should be cautious  
22:31
of the oversaturation of an image leading to  reduced development, it's worth acknowledging  
22:37
that the magical hedonistic bisexual is  more likely than past bi tropes to actually  
22:44
be rounded. They have hedonistic tendencies  but they are not solely a detached glutton.
a tale of two hedonists
22:53
[“Tell Me” by Ryan Little] Speaking of Thor: Ragnarok, as an  overindulgent, morally ambiguous antagonist,  
23:02
Loki, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe  not necessarily Norse mythology,   is a pretty decent example of the type of man  who is allowed to be bi plus on film and TV:  
23:13
a little magical, a little hedonistic, a lot  of angst and a few outlandish accessories.  
23:20
More importantly MCU Loki is a now canonically bi  character who has been developed past his role as  
23:28
the evil magical hedonist. But I want to look at  him in contrast with Valkyrie, who similarly is bi  
23:35
in the comics but, unlike Loki, her sexuality  hasn't been stated in the cinematic universe. Plus  
23:42
there is a marked difference in how their  sexualities were going to be confirmed   in the first place. Loki references his  bisexuality via a conversation with Sylvie,  
23:53
an alternate universe version of himself. The  scene confirms two characters as bi plus without  
23:59
relying on a showcase of hedonism or hypersexual  behavior to get the point across. Notably,  
24:05
this scene occurred because a bi director with  a compatible writer's room wanted to acknowledge  
24:11
this aspect of Loki through conversation  specifically. Part of the importance in having  
24:17
a character reference being attracted to more  than one gender is that audience's understanding  
24:24
of this character's sexuality is often based  off of who they are currently partnered with.  
24:30
There are a lot of bi characters who never  explicitly say that they are bi, or that they are  
24:36
attracted to multiple genders, and that in turn  makes bi erasure much easier. As for Valkyrie,  
24:42
Tessa Thompson shared in an interview that they  wanted to confirm that character sexuality by  
24:47
having a woman walk out of her bedroom but  the scene was cut. You could argue that such   a scene wouldn't have been family friendly, but  my counter-argument is to find a different way  
24:57
to confirm her is bi then. While the iron tight  grip of Disney's conservative corporate values  
25:02
are definitely a factor here, I do wonder why the  plan wasn't to give Valkyrie a conversation or a  
25:09
flashback that made things just as clear. Also,  returning to the connection between bisexuality  
25:15
and neon, although this isn't as explicit as some  other examples, the choice does tap into the trend  
25:22
of presenting bisexuality as an intense burst of  eye-catching behavior. What is also reflected in  
25:29
wanting to confirm Valkyrie as bi via a sexually  suggestive scene is another downfall to portraying  
25:36
bi characters as hedonists first: we often don't  get to see them experience non-sexual intimacy.  
25:43
Beautifully filmed orgies? By the buckets.  But care and connection? We na have dat.
25:50
While both of these characters pull from  the magical hedonistic bisexual trope, one   presents a stronger opportunity to diverge from  it. Just as a note, race does play a factor here.  
26:02
From the trope assigned to Valkyrie in Endgame  and the way “magical” means something different  
26:07
for Black and biracial characters to the amount  of screen time and development Loki has been given  
26:14
in comparison to practically any other secondary  MCU character. We aren't exploring that today but  
26:22
I do want to acknowledge this layer as well.  Back to Valkyrie, to have her juggle hedonism  
26:27
and alcoholism throughout her development  but remove explicitly labeling her as bi  
26:33
is a lost chance to challenge the stereotype of  the gluttonous bisexual. Plus when you consider  
26:40
that the depth of her grief, which is the  source of her alcoholism, wasn't explored as  
26:45
much in Thor: Ragnarok as Thompson's interview  would make you think, the missed opportunities to  
26:51
confirm Valkyrie is bi without focusing on sex are  also failed chances to further build her backstory  
26:59
and our understanding of who she is. And then  Endgame wanted to make Thor's storyline a  
27:06
three-hour long fat joke instead of genuinely  exploring his relationships with other people,  
27:11
so any chance of development was lost  there as well. While Loki also has to  
27:17
deal with his overindulgence, he is given  the time to name that he wants attention,  
27:22
often via overindulgence, because he is afraid of  being alone. In his TV series Loki pulls apart his  
27:29
understanding of his identity and particularly  his loneliness and the things that that fear  
27:35
drives him to do. Loki moves beyond just being  a trope fulfilling a role while Valkyrie ends up  
27:42
flattened by Endgame’s Fisher-Price feminism to  become a different trope fulfilling a different  
27:48
role. Her individual potential, the exploration  and celebration of her otherness abandoned  
27:55
while Loki's is centered. In these two we  see how chaotic bisexuals can be developed  
28:01
to embrace that chaos or how they can be thinned  out once that disorder is no longer entertaining.
28:07
[“Tell Me” by Ryan Little]
okay but, why do they need to be bi?
28:14
To be clear, I'm not trying to prevent anyone from  headcanoning any of these characters as gay. But  
28:23
it's worth exploring the bisexual potential of  multiple kinds of characters for what it means  
28:28
about deconstructing tropes and stereotypes about  bi people as well as challenging latent biphobia,  
28:36
specifically how bi erasure is facilitated because  a character never explicitly said that they are  
28:42
attracted to multiple genders. With regards  to male characters, they are often labeled as  
28:48
gay in order to remove female characters that  the audience doesn't like or as a way to strongly  
28:54
connect masculinity to sexuality. Starting with  bi erasure for the sake of a slash ship, a darling  
29:01
example is James Flint from Black Sails. When we  start the show James is partnered with Miranda  
29:07
but as the story progresses we learn that he also  loved her husband Thomas, and it suggested that  
29:13
they were in a whole ass throuple at one point.  However, if you go through fandom, a lot of times  
29:19
James's love for Miranda is erased or discussed as  her being his beard in order for fans to amplify  
29:27
focus on James's relationship with Thomas. Fans  who don't like or aren't interested in Miranda can  
29:33
write her out of the story without interrogating  why they feel the need to negate James's  
29:39
attraction to women in order to validate his  relationship with a man. Black Sails also gives us  
29:45
an example of masculinity being tied to sexuality  with Jack Rackham, a man with terrible facial hair  
29:53
and - I don't want to say flamboyant fashion  choices but the man has a denim pirate coat,  
30:00
okay? Choices were made. He also favors using his  wit over his strength and for the first half of  
30:07
the show he's seen more with women than with men  and perhaps because of some combination of these  
30:13
things Jack is often perceived as gay, even though  he's never shown having any interest in any man  
30:21
in a show that would be okay with doing that.  It's worth questioning why varying degrees of  
30:28
masculinity are immediately tied to sexuality in  a way that doesn't allow the exploration of either  
30:34
of those things. I'm old enough to remember when  “metrosexual” was a thing and although that term,  
30:41
like shutter shades, is no longer in production,  we haven't moved far past feeling the need to  
30:48
categorize men's behavior in ways that directly  connect to sexuality. Another way to look at this  
30:54
reduction of character expression is through the  fandom specific obsession with labeling men as  
31:02
“tops” or “bottoms,” or for all the yaoi consumers  out there “seme” and “uke.” Does this man fit into  
31:10
my headcanon as the soft sweet one getting pounded  or the big strong one doing the pounding? A lot of  
31:18
racism be jumping out here tambien with  the way men of color are headcanoned,   but that's another topic for another day. Jaskier  is another character who could be read as bi but  
31:30
has been reshaped by the fandom through their  defining him as gay. Jaskier is a character from  
31:37
The Witcher, a book, game, and television series  that has been getting more attention because of  
31:42
said television series. With the first season  came a ton of people shipping Geralt, the main  
31:48
character, with Jaskier, one of his companions -  which like, whatever y'all goo goo for white men,  
31:54
what else is new? But in said shipping, a lot of  people also began to label Jaskier as a twink.  
32:01
This man is six foot tall, broad shouldered, hairy  chest; he doesn't fit the description your honor.  
32:09
And yet somebody “has” to be the bottom and the  bottom “has” to behave and look a certain way,  
32:16
so Jaskier gets reformed in fandom to fit this  idea of what a smaller, maybe more feminine,  
32:24
bottom would look and act like. This limited idea  of how relationships between two men can function  
32:30
flattens out all queer men, but for the focus  of this conversation it specifically pushes  
32:36
out bi men for being considered just as they  are. If the bi man is someone like Jaskier,  
32:43
who's read by some fans as being a twink bottom  even though he doesn't canonically look or behave  
32:49
the way that label is perceived, how can he  also be read as someone appealing to or being  
32:56
interested in anyone other than big strong hash  slinging slashers? If this character is bi,  
33:03
can he fit so easily into the binary of pound  or be pounded? Remember earlier we talked about  
33:10
bi men facing issues dating women because they  aren't perceived as masculine enough? This is  
33:16
another version of that. A skewed interpretation  of who this man is and how he behaves based off of  
33:23
the fact that he experiences attraction to other  men. This interpretation, like many of bi men,  
33:30
does not see women as an option that he would  want or attract. It's not that women can't  
33:37
be interested in waif-like men, but if you're  using gay terminology, you are making a specific  
33:44
choice okay? You know what you're doing - arguably  because again, the man is not a twink, but you get  
33:50
what I mean. Remolding characters like James and  Jaskier might be more appealing for some members  
33:56
of fandom, but they also erase the potential, or  the reality, of their bisexuality, often in ways  
34:04
that feed into biphobic, limited, and/or reductive  thought patterns in the process. As I mentioned  
34:10
earlier, women can diverge from femininity and  still be desired by men in a way that is not true  
34:17
in the inverse. Though again, this is in limited,  specific ways and often dependent on race,  
34:24
class, and body type among other traits. However,  when this potential for acceptable fluidity  
34:31
mixes with a similar fan desire to not see  this character partner with other characters,  
34:38
the result is often bi erasure. If you read  Ellie from The Half of It as bi for example,  
34:45
then th","sorry again for the glitchy video. the perks of recording on a web cam.

the black right wing of american
0:23
politics is one of the most frankly
0:24
weird and inexplicable phenomena in
0:26
american politics in a country torn
0:29
apart by racial resentment and supremacy
0:31
divided into camps based on real
0:32
material action individual solutions and
0:34
denial of the problem even exists the
0:37
black right wing serves as one of the
0:38
more shocking aspects of our political
0:40
environment and one that is either
0:42
ignored by white leftists and liberals
0:43
were incapable of approaching political
0:45
critiques of black people they disagree
0:46
without being racist or addressed in
0:49
terrible ways that come off as racist i
0:51
think with a lot of the assumptions that
0:52
go on within our society based on race a
0:54
lot of people don't know how to react to
0:56
this block of black people who are more
0:57
aligned with those who historically have
0:59
not really served the interests of black
1:01
people in this country
1:03
among the most famous of these black
1:04
conservatives are figures like larry
1:06
elder candace owens and christian walker
1:08
and a whole rabbit hole of others i'm
1:10
mostly singling out these three because
1:11
candace owens is the most well-known of
1:13
these figures larry elder was recently
1:16
relevant before he got blown out of the
1:17
water in an election
1:19
and christian walker is just
1:21
inexplicable day one of pride month
1:23
starbucks started hanging the rainbow
1:24
flag it's july
1:26
where are the american flags
1:28
where are they you were uh you know what
1:30
fine we'll talk to the manager at the
1:32
drive-thru window oh yes we will because
1:34
you were all about visibility and
1:38
inclusion during pride month well i feel
1:40
included invisible under the american
1:42
flag where's my flag where's my
1:44
these figures serve a very specific
1:46
purpose within the republican party
1:47
establishment
1:49
because they aren't really super popular
1:51
with black people they mostly exist as a
1:53
bastion for conservatives to use to say
1:55
they aren't racist because they have
1:56
these black figures on their side though
1:59
they do also help to soften conservative
2:01
messages to a minority among the black
2:02
community and tug them right one of the
2:04
main ways they achieve these two goals
2:07
is by playing their trump card democrats
2:09
are racist too which as someone who has
2:11
gone on record saying the dems are
2:12
neoliberal fascists i absolutely agree
2:15
with
2:15
the problem with that statement is that
2:17
it's incomplete for one it's common
2:19
consensus among the black community that
2:21
all white people can exhibit some form
2:22
of racism whether it's more passive and
2:24
annoying than harmful or outright
2:26
genocidal hell white anarchists can be
2:28
super racist too or just really awkward
2:31
when talking about race
2:33
on top of that the democratic and
2:34
republican party switched platforms back
2:36
in like the 60s or whatever so while one
2:39
party is considered racist now and the
2:41
other may not be seen as being as racist
2:43
it's not a sign that one ideology is
2:45
more racism than the other because the
2:46
party switched which platform and
2:48
ideology they had based on race which
2:50
doesn't even get into the fact that both
2:51
parties support capitalist power
2:52
relations which have facilitated and
2:54
systematized racism since their
2:56
conception as well as both the imperius
2:58
and colonialist on top of that both
3:00
bought into the whole war on crime tough
3:02
on crime rhetoric because democrats
3:05
realized it was the only way they could
3:06
win elections for a certain time period
3:09
the problem they are pointing out is
3:10
real but the solution while absolutely
3:12
being to break with the democratic party
3:14
is not to go for the right it's to go
3:16
further left to acknowledge how our
3:18
current systems perpetuate racism unless
3:20
abolished and replaced with systems of
3:21
direct democracy and non-hierarchical
3:24
community level organizing
3:26
providing communities with the resources
3:28
and ability to directly control
3:29
themselves while decriminalizing
3:31
nonviolent drug charges making mental
3:33
health more easily available and
3:35
providing people with democratic
3:36
workplaces that pay them thriving wages
3:38
and give them more individual autonomy
3:40
would help to deal with a lot of those
3:41
systemic forms of racism while the more
3:44
social aspects that they point out will
3:45
require patience and education more
3:47
opportunities for community involvement
3:49
and time this relates to the other claim
3:51
that they use that black people are
3:53
racist too which
3:54
yeah depending on how you're talking
3:56
about race
3:58
when people talk about systemic racism
3:59
that is something that relates to and
4:01
serves white supremacy so black people
4:02
aren't really necessarily capable
4:04
of being racist in that sense although
4:06
they like larry elder for example can
4:08
absolutely help to further the white
4:10
supremacy but there is a second kind of
4:12
racism that's not systemic but social
4:14
anyone can participate in that when you
4:16
express racist ideas about asian people
4:18
or indigenous people and such that makes
4:20
you racist regardless of your race but
4:23
much like the last point this isn't the
4:24
own they think it is
4:26
accepting that point is true does not
4:28
necessarily mean the next step is to
4:29
join the republican party
4:31
this video isn't even necessarily for me
4:33
to go into debunking the worst takes of
4:35
black right-wing figures because none of
4:36
them say anything unique from what most
4:39
republican talking points already are
4:41
debunking candice owens would lead to
4:43
saying a lot of the same stuff that i'd
4:44
say if i was debunking someone like ben
4:46
shapiro that it's already been spilled
4:48
by other people for example candace
4:50
promotes the blex foundation and here's
4:52
her pinned tweet regarding that
4:55
none of these points are really
4:56
supported the all black lives being
4:58
supported in line is especially funny
4:59
because the common slogan that blm
5:01
protests is all black lives matter
5:02
specifically in reference to lgbt black
5:04
people and especially black trans people
5:07
while candace owens doesn't really seem
5:09
to have the kindest view of trans people
5:11
even their youtube channel does not
5:12
present any new arguments or information
5:14
for black people to receive regarding
5:15
racism or the black right wings counter
5:17
to blm
5:19
not even counting the fact that even the
5:21
farthest right black people i've met in
5:23
the streets are still pro blm
5:25
a lot of the time
5:27
they just have different and more
5:28
exclusionary solutions
5:30
the blexit foundation to my knowledge
5:32
doesn't even seem to share as much of
5:34
the same fervor of figures like candace
5:36
owens and larry elder also it turns out
5:38
candace owens stole the name plexid for
5:40
that org from another organization by
5:42
the same name founded by another black
5:43
woman that was created in response to
5:45
the philando castile police murder as a
5:48
decentralized effort to give black
5:49
people more economic autonomy and the
5:51
org candice has doesn't seem to really
5:54
be doing much at all other than
5:55
platforming black conservatives and
5:56
doing rallies and
5:58
making money and selling merch the end
6:00
of the day that's what these people are
6:01
really doing making money
6:04
candace owens used to be super
6:05
anti-conservative even she didn't flip
6:07
until her anti-cyber harassment website
6:09
got shot down by liberals for being a
6:11
terrible idea and then she got attention
6:13
from conservatives these people
6:15
shouldn't be taken any more seriously
6:16
than other conservatives i think what's
6:18
also worth noting here is something
6:19
related to lawrence dennis one of the
6:21
first american fascists and a secret
6:23
black man who was able to pass somewhat
6:25
for white to hide his identity he made a
6:27
lot of money doing that but his
6:28
allegiance to the american right-wing
6:30
and fascism was more likely a survival
6:31
thing trying to avoid racism by
6:33
appealing to the racists if you can't
6:35
beat them join them and i think that's
6:37
what happened to a lot of people here
6:39
so regardless remember when you see
6:41
these figures promoting narratives on
6:42
race that serve white power structures
6:44
criticizing a democratic party
6:47
or pushing the same races and
6:48
unempathetic policies that have damaged
6:50

6:51
right-wing behaviors that they are the
6:53
problem not the solution the solution is
6:55
not the democratic party either i would
6:57
never suggest that
6:59
it's building up community power dual

power mutual aid and autonomy for black
7:03
communities as well as pushing for
7:05
solutions to crime and poverty that
7:08
don't inflict more violence on people

but instead hit the problem at its root

On Leftist Disunity,"72,060","7,200",10/27/21,11:34,"0:00
Not long after I’d become radicalized, began delving into the all-important capital T Theory,
0:05
and started passively lurking the discourse, I very quickly realized that the things I
0:10
thought defined the Left were the very things that were the greatest points of contention.
0:14
The movement I thought shared some basic common goals wasn’t even a single movement.
0:19
In fact, I realized that some of these ideologies don’t even go to the same school.
0:24
Despite the ever present media narratives about how “the left is doing this” and
0:28
“the left thinks this,” I’ve heard it said in these circles that if you get ten
0:32
socialists in a room, you’ll hear twenty different opinions.
0:35
And I wish that was an exaggeration.
0:38
Long story short, I came to the realization that the Left has never been united, and never
0:43
will be.
0:44
And that’s okay.
0:45
First of all, what is the Left?
what is the left
0:48
The terms “left-wing” and “right-wing” came out of the seating arrangements in the
0:52
French Estates General during the French Revolution.
0:55
Those who sat on the left opposed the Ancien Régime, supporting ze Revolution, Republic,
1:00
and Secular Society.
1:02
Those who sat on the right supported Tradition, Religion, and the Ancien Régime.
1:07
Generally speaking, when people refer to the left, though Overton Windows vary from place
1:11
to place, they’re generally referring to politics concerned with social equality and
1:17
egalitarianism, as opposed to the right, which generally supports tradition, the status quo,
1:23
and the inevitability of hierarchy and inequality.
1:26
For some folks, socially progressive politics is enough for them to assign you the label
1:31
“left-wing”.
1:32
For other folks, vague anti-capitalism is a necessary prerequisite to distinguish themselves
1:38
from the dreaded liberals.
1:40
Since the days of 18th century French Republicanism, the term Left has been applied to all kinds
1:45
of divergent and overlapping movements: communism, the labour movement, Marxism, social democracy,
1:53
feminism, LGBT rights, the anti-war movement, the civil rights movement, and even anarchism.
2:00
Which is strange if you remember that neither the left nor right side of the French Estates
2:05
General actually wanted to abolish hierarchy.
2:10
If you were to ask any conservative what the Left is, they’d tell you that they’re
2:14
a bunch of God-hating, city-burning commie soyboys or something.
2:17
If you were to ask a radical centrist, they’d tell you the Left has some good ideas but
2:22
“they go too far.”
2:24
And if you were to ask today’s “leftists” what the Left is, be prepared to navigate
2:29
a sea of contradictions, wade through a jungle of discourse, and amass a theory reading list
2:35
far longer than one’s lifetime.
2:38
I’m exaggerating only slightly.
2:40
Among this pandemonium, there is the ever-present cry to unite the left.
2:45
Perhaps you’ve heard it.
2:47
Surely, if we’d only see what we have in common, we’d be able to Voltron ourselves
2:51
out of the hell of capitalism.
2:53
But no, instead we have to get hung up on petty arguments, majoring over minors and
2:58
making mountains out of molehills.
3:00
I can’t help but question where folks are getting this impression that the Left has
3:04
ever been or can ever be united.
3:07
The Left is barely even a coherent concept.
3:10
A cursory glance at broadly “leftist” history, one I’d rather not see repeated,
3:15
is replete with examples of division, between the thinkers and between the movers and shakers.
3:22
The First Internationale eventually split between statists and anarchists all the way
3:27
in 1872, and then when the Second Internationale was founded, excluding the anarchists, it
3:32
split again due to their different stances during World War 1.
3:35
The Third Internationale excluded non Marxist-Leninists and the Fourth Internationale excluded non
3:41
Trotskyists.
3:42
Beyond the very obvious theoretical splits within Marxism itself, and between Marxism
3:47
and Anarchism, we’ve also seen the consequences of blatant divisions bear out in reality,
3:53
most famously with the Soviet Union’s brutal crackdown on non-Bolshevik socialists and
3:58
especially anarchists after the revolution, a pattern that would be replicated in other
4:03
revolutions of the 20th century.
4:05
During the Spanish Civil War, assassinations of anti-Stalinist socialists continued under
4:11
the NKVD.
4:12
And the Spanish Left, united behind the Popular Front, felt the strain and eventual irreconcilable
4:18
splits within the coalition of Republicans, Social Democrats, Anarchists, Libertarian
4:24
Marxists, Marxist-Leninists, and Syndicalists.
4:28
Reformist and revolutionary segments of the many American civil rights movements, each
4:32
with their own visions of liberation, would also come together and fall apart throughout
4:36
the struggle.
4:37
You can honestly point to any movement or revolution under the banner of leftism and
4:43
find a web of factions and groups that worked with and against each other to advance their
4:48
various, distinct causes.
4:50
The reality is that real world politics can’t be so easily simplified into this binary narrative,
4:55
and attempts to force reality to fit the mold only serves to delay the inevitable consequences
5:02
of incompatibility.
5:03
People say things like, “yeah the left has its differences, but let’s unite now to
5:08
defeat capitalism and then we can argue about the next step afterwards!”
5:12
But this is not a game.
5:14
Capitalism is not the final boss.
5:17
Unity is not some superficial declaration.
5:19
Revolution is not a single, simple, linear event, set in the distant future.
5:25
Nuance matters.
5:27
Definitions matter.
5:29
Means and ends matter.
5:31
Goals, both short term and long term, diverge significantly under the banner of leftism,
5:36
and so do tactics and strategies.
5:40
Values are important and fundamental differences cannot be so easily overlooked.
5:45
Electoralism and anti-electoralism are incompatible.
5:49
Statism and anti-statism are incompatible.
5:53
Workerism and anti-work are incompatible.
5:57
Landback and settler colonialism are incompatible.
6:00
Productivism and degrowth are incompatible.
6:03
Identity politics and anti-idpol are incompatible.
6:08
Differences of opinions, differences of values have an impact on the level of organizing
6:14
people of such oppositional opinions can reasonably carry out together.
6:18
Put them all under the umbrella of Leftism if you’d like, or maybe exclude some of
6:22
them, as folks are keen to do, but don’t pikachu face when you see Black anarchists,
6:26
for example, refusing to work with class reductionists.
6:29
Don’t be surprised if you see the Zapatistas making statements like this.
6:33
Don’t be shocked if actual libertarian socialists don’t all line up to support your favourite
6:38
social democrat.
6:39
Don’t act confused when anarchists don’t blindly accept the state propaganda of other
6:43
countries, and actually listen to the dissenting voices from those places.
6:48
And if you unwisely decided to take the plunge into the chaos of Twitter discourse, recognize
6:53
at the very least that this meme is practically meaningless.
6:57
“But what about the right?”
6:59
What about them?
7:01
We’re not trying to emulate the right.
7:04
Besides the fact that they too have disagreements, the right has it easy.
7:08
Their ideas are long established.
7:10
They hold power on all levels of society; their aim is mainly to maintain the status
7:16
quo or return to a previously established status quo.
7:19
“The Left” is on a whole different wavelength.
7:22
“Leftism” isn’t specific enough or grounded enough or unambiguous enough to build a world-changing,
7:29
future-defining movement off of.
7:30
In fact, I’d go a step further and argue that even socialism and communism are often
7:35
too broadly defined to actually coalesce around.
7:38
But here’s what I’m not saying.
what i'm not saying
7:40
I’m not saying that people early in their radicalization process are bad for identifying
7:45
as leftists.
7:47
Everyone starts somewhere.
7:48
I’m not mad at people who see value in the term or identify as such.
7:53
We simply disagree.
7:54
But like I said in my video on why “anti-capitalism” is capitalist, keep going further and keep
8:00
learning more.
8:01
I’m not saying never use the term “left” either.
8:04
It can be a useful shorthand at times.
8:06
I’m just saying it’s useless when it comes to actual, meaningful coalition building.
8:11
I’m also not saying never build bridges or never work with people who don’t have
8:16
your exact politics.
8:18
My vision is of a world in which many worlds exist.
8:21
So I work with people I disagree with, but I also know my limits.
8:25
I know the extent to which we can effectively work together and we maintain those parameters.
8:29
And we still learn from each other.
8:32
I’m just saying, I don’t care to “gatekeep leftism.”
8:35
I’m not attached to it.
8:37
It’s a label that’s slapped on any and everybody, and each person has their own idea
8:41
of who is or isn’t “a real leftist.”
8:44
I know where I stand, and it isn’t as a mere “subcategory” of “leftism.”
moving forward
8:49
Moving forward though, my focus is mainly on sharing my perspective and my principles;
8:55
on actively organizing my people, in every way I know how, with my values at the forefront;
9:00
and on building coalitions, locally, regionally, and internationally, based on the same, in
9:06
order to develop resilience, autonomy, safety, and care.
9:11
I know I can’t control the global, but the local is in all of our hands.
9:18
As climate collapse descends upon us all, I don't have time to waste on canvassing for
9:23
politicians who do not care about me.
9:25
I don’t have time to convince people to join some vanguard party.
9:27
I don’t have time for so-called radicals who are comfortable ignoring the real struggle
9:34
of those under their favourite states.
9:36
I don’t have time to wait around for some imaginary global capital R Revolution like
9:41
it’s the Rapture.
9:42
Time and energy are limited, why spend them trying to fit together pieces from completely
9:47
different puzzles?
9:49
I’m in coalition with people who want to tear down systems of domination, not just
9:53
reshuffle the halls of power, through reform OR revolution.
9:57
I’m in coalition with people I can share knowledge with, have fun with, stay grounded
10:03
with, and create the future with.
10:04
I’m in coalition with people in deed, not just in word.
10:09
The revolution is now.
10:11
Peace.
10:12
Outro This video is a bit different from what I
10:16
usually do, but I just had to get this off my chest.
10:19
It’s kind of in the same vein as my anti-capitalism is capitalist video, which I didn’t expect
10:24
to blow up as much as it did.
10:25
I just thought it would be a good idea to further clarify one of the points I brought
10:29
up in that video.
10:30
And if this video also blows up, and you’re new here, check out my other videos, please.
10:35
I got a bunch of comments last time asking me questions that could easily be answered
10:40
by a quick look at my previous work.
10:42
This video doesn’t exist in isolation, it’s a continuation of what came before.
10:46
I suggest starting with Why Revolution Needs Therapy.
10:49

Thanks again, peace!","Watch the whole video before commenting. As I’ve expressed in the past, I don’t self-identify as a ""leftist"" because I believe it's too broad to meaningfully encapsulate the vast diversity of perspectives under its banner. I just wanted to clarify my position in greater detail in this video so that y’all understand where I’m coming from, even if you disagree. Peace!

so in the following years as the anti-sjw channel has lost a lot of steam as a content formula we have inversely
0:10
seen the rise of the leftist youtuber their intended goal was directly
0:15
engaging in de-radicalization and rehabilitation of a variety of young and impressionable white mostly male minds
0:22
bread tube and leftist youtube has created its own rabbit hole through which youtube can funnel views and
0:28
traffic which also means eyeballs and adsense so guys like thought slime and
0:34
sean were able to come on and grow pretty significantly and make waves then you have guys like solari john the
0:39
duncan that were able to follow suit as long as you are a white guy and you're willing to go through the rite of
0:45
passage that is making your anti-bench shapiro video you will have the opportunity to make
0:50
money and sustain a career as a leftist content creator but as i'm clearly alluding to the bread
0:56
tuber and its consumers definitely fit a specific description one in which
1:02
youtube clearly recognizes not as a social movement or political ideology
1:08
but a target demographic and because that demographic is largely white and largely male and not an insignificant
1:15
amount of those people that are in that demographic are low-key recovering from being white supremacists and fascists
1:22
that means a lot [Music]

[Applause] [Music]
How Did I Get Here?
2:20
[Music]
2:32
[Music] so let's talk about the elephant in the room shall we this is a youtube silver
2:40
plaque and if i could get it up there it does say fd signifier and that's me
2:48
i made it started from the bottom now we're here and you know how much
2:54
i love me some drake but much like drake um this
2:59
doesn't say as much about me as a content creator as you might think you get this plaque by getting a hundred
3:05
thousand subscribers which is is a feat it is something that's unique and difficult to do
3:12
um only as there's 37 million ish youtube channels on the platform
3:19
and only about probably at this point maybe 280 000 will ever reach
3:25
this and i did it in a year
3:31
and to be real i did it in like two months because i spent the first year
3:36
trying to figure out how to get the algorithm to respect my gangster and then finally after
3:41
a little help which i'll get to later and a viral video success has followed there's so much
3:49
more to that story uh it's much much deeper than that in fact you know thank
3:54
you right to to everyone who made this possible like don't get me wrong definitely
4:00
appreciate this how did i get here how how did i make this happen am i just that good and i will say yes i
4:08
think i'm pretty good at this is it just you know a couple of connections did i did i joined the
4:13
illuminati like what separates me from the
4:20
millions possibly of other black ran channels many i'm sure are trying to do educational analytical content
4:28
why do i feel like such a unicorn there's a lot to be said about how you got here to watch me in the first place
4:33
what made you click this thumbnail are you a long time subscriber did the
4:39
i'll admit it i'm definitely planning a very messy drama inducing thumbnail draw you in
4:45
are you going to subscribe are you still watching because you know almost 50 of people were gone by now at this point
4:51
what got this video an fd signifier in front of your phone or computer screen
4:59
and why is that mechanism so important to
5:05
making this possible and not even just this like the gold ones the platinum ones
5:12
or just people that run a side hustle there's a lot to that especially when the video starts
5:18
and you see this face and that is even more significant in this educational left tube bread tube space
5:26
where you would think there'd be plenty of people that look like me and there are but i can't help but feel like
5:33
there's a different set of pathways to success for
5:39
content creators that look like me versus content creators that look like some of the people you saw in the intro
5:45
in fact i'm almost positive and i became aware of this before the blow up when i finally just
5:52
got to the point where i could get monetized i was making this video called black men in love on screen or something
5:59
along those lines and right now i was just called black man in love and i was working so hard on it and i
6:06
was so proud of it i interviewed all these black men from a diverse background of experiences
6:12
and i wanted us to talk about love and relationships from just our perspective
6:19
in a way that i thought at the time was more complex and deeper than really most
6:25
black men got to speak on and that was the response it got and i was i'm still proud of that it's probably one of my
6:31
top five favorite videos i've done to this day but do you know that video almost never
6:37
got there and it wasn't because of copyright it wasn't because of a lack of
6:43
effort it was because something about the title black men in love
6:49
made youtube flag it for demonetization and manual review and it
6:55
did it after the video had already been checked by the bots and what i found out and i'll put the
7:02
footage here is that what was triggering this manual review was simply the title
7:07
black men and love and it was galling that something as simple as talking about
7:14
love from a black man's perspective required a little bit more oversight it's like [ __ ] what you talking about what's this
7:21
really and i've actually had the opportunity to talk to people within youtube about what
7:28
happened there and talk to people who are experts in these spaces and i understand what it is now
7:34
but it still shouldn't happen and what i've come to realize since then
7:42
is that there are so many small pitfalls and larger barriers to
7:48
black content creators who don't want to do makeup tutorials or sports
7:55
or drama who want to sit in front of the camera and educate
8:01
and commentate to keep them from getting here
8:07
it's already hard enough to get here in the first place but to get here as an educational channel
8:13
it's a whole different set of issues and so this video is going to be explaining all of those things
8:19
and to get it started as any good video essay channel should
The Untold History of Breadtube/Lefttube
8:24
let's get into some history so first let's map out the origins of bread tube now you can find a lot of
8:30
videos that give you like the history of bread tube and all of that and like i'm not gonna poo poo that but i'm gonna go
8:37
in a slightly different direction or at least go a little bit further back because i think at least for me it's not
8:44
just about who started it but like who was it started for what was in the
8:49
environment to make something like leftist youtube red tube pop and become a theme become an area
8:56
for lucrative content creation only a few years ago after
9:01
many years of the wild west nonsense going going on youtube
9:06
youtube started in 2005 by such and such whoever these guys are
9:11
and then they eventually sold to google so i don't even know if these guys are still around but congratulations they got like a billion dollars good job guys
9:19
initially nobody really knew what to do with youtube it was a place to mostly share family videos and sometimes those
9:24
family videos would have two beautiful white babies with british accents and it would go viral and you know that was it
9:32
but early on although it was still mostly nonsense there were attempts at
9:38
independent content creation by people like ryan higa and fred and a lot of
9:44
like ogs on the platform and along with them you did see the emergence of future crossover megastars like issa ray and
9:50
donald glover by the early 2010s many aspiring entertainers were on the platform making
9:56
a mix of scripted vlog and reaction based content and dominating the platform while making good money for the
10:03
most part these figures were making content still in the mode of mainstream entertainment things were maybe a bit
10:09
more varied and weird at times but it was still sketch comedy reactions to funny interesting stuff pranks music etc
10:17
the only real standout stuff that was unique to youtube was the let's play
10:22
gaming community which to this day is a juggernaut on the platform and the video essay or its earliest
10:30
renditions i should say the video essay actually has some official background informal criticism and academia but i
10:37
don't i don't really care for me the origins trace back to two figures and these figures still to this day make
10:42
content on the platform and their content then and now is emblematic of something really
10:50
profound and important to understand because it spoke to who was making content
10:56
and who that content was initially for and it started the tradition that i like to call the angry white guy yelling at
11:03
the screen or the augie for short because you all know i like making [ __ ] up [Music]
11:09
these two men were the nostalgia critic aka that guy with the glasses aka doug walker and the angry video game nerd aka
11:16
james rolfe both started on the platform almost at the very beginning and both would lay foundational pieces as to what
11:23
was expected from the augie video type content creator the augie formula was
11:29
pretty simple and ubiquitous at the time the augie would introduce their particular topic of the day and discuss
11:34
or critique it in a chronological order while yelling and making jokes it was an
11:40
interesting time and like i'm being glib about it but no this was a new frontier
11:45
of entertainment and for a second society that hadn't ever been so explicitly catered to
11:51
this was a big deal this was the first time that socially marginal young men the vast majority of which who were
11:57
white and heterosexual had this type of content geared to their
12:03
interests explicitly it was nerd humor and because it was so unique it garnered a huge following and die hard fans it
12:11
was definitely boy's humor it's edgy and obnoxious but so were we at the time
12:17
it was our entertainment it was the type of content that could only be appreciated and made by socially
12:24
marginal guys who spent their high school nights staying up late playing video games and watching mystery science
12:31
theater 3000 while the angry video game nerd chugged along fine on youtube and has been a damn near one-man show this
12:38
whole time walker would almost immediately leave youtube for it's at the time more serious competitor blip tv
12:46
there he would be able to more easily avoid youtube's draconian copyright laws but he also created a pretty unique
12:52
thing at the time in channel awesome with his brother and their business partner whose name i'm forgetting i
12:58
heard he's kind of awful so i'll just leave him out they became like a new media record label an umbrella imprint
13:03
and they recruited similar algia jace conte creators to make content on their site a lot of the
13:10
people that were on channel awesome during this heyday are still making content to this day with the most
13:15
significant alumni being current left tube bread tube juggernaut crossover success and in my opinion the
13:22
true innovator of the modern video essay on youtube lindsey ellis lindsay ellis won a contest to get her her own spot on
13:29
the channel which at the time was a relatively big deal and immediately became a standout among the numerous
13:35
other augies on the website as she was just well better than all of them by a pretty
13:40
wide margin in part this was due to her just being razor sharp with her wit and funnier even in that boy's humor edge
13:48
lord style of comedy but it was also because she added a level of expertise and sophistication to go along with the
13:54
crass humor and in the beginning her content on the channel followed that same chronological riffing format as her
14:00
argue peers however lindsay would eventually depart from that format and give us what i think is the most common
14:06
template for most media-centered video essays which is looking through her work thematically or technically as opposed
14:12
to just summarizing it lindsay would draw upon sociological historical political all these other elements to
14:19
analyze a work in its entirety while still being funny and it made her
14:24
content really engaging it made it challenging it made it edutainment i
14:29
know not everybody watched lindsay ellis during this time period or before the last couple of years and we'll talk
14:35
about that later but she needs to get her flowers and respect for making this a thing
14:42
even if you've never seen her before this is lindsey ellis sadly and importantly
14:49
as it previews problems that i will speak on later the people behind the scenes that channel awesome with lindsey
14:54
ellis and several in front of the scenes turned out to be kind of shitty there's a ton more to this story if you want to
15:00
find out about the ugly history of channel austin i'll put some links in the description but lindsay became less and less comfortable with the type of
15:06
energy and behavior that permeated the channel awesome and left in 2014 for youtube enjoying pretty good
15:13
moderate success at the time the key thing i want to point out is that while lindsay was the true innovator of this
15:19
format of content she and channel also weren't the only ones really creating a wave on blip and setting the groundwork
15:27
for this becoming as ubiquitous as it is there definitely was a group of other
15:32
creators on blip tv that had a huge influence on the video essay concept on
15:38
youtube red leather media got his start in 2008 with mike staclosa and jay bauman who first like many early
15:44
creators tried their hand at independent content that was more in the vein of mainstream content in the form of short
15:49
films and skits and things along those lines mike and his best friend rich evans have been making
15:56
stuff since they were kids and then something significant happened mike using a character that was
16:01
originated by rich evans called mr plinkett made a review for star wars the phantom menace and this review would
16:08
change the game star wars the phantom menace was the most disappointing thing since my son i
16:15
mean how much more could you possibly [ __ ] up the entire backstory to star wars craft that would go through the
16:21
planet's core or did you just plan to run along the surface what's wrong with your face it's hard to explain how big
16:29
this review is in retrospect because social media like as a hype machine didn't exist at the time but i'd
16:36
arguably say that this video and its follow-ups are probably some of the most influential pieces of film criticism and
16:42
analysis on youtube the insight the critique the analysis
16:48
and the humor although dated and definitely problematic by today's standards were all incredibly
16:53
influential and spawned an entire new genre of other august and white guys in
16:58
general complaining about movies and video games on the internet they took the auggie appeal that originated with
17:05
nostalgia critic and angry video game nerd and blew it up what made them
17:10
special is they were just like lindsay ellis better than all the people doing it and their mix of humor along with the
17:17
fact that they also like lindsay ellis had real education in film and media
17:23
just made it a cut above anything else that looked like that and everything else that came after that
17:30
had some of the same energy for years red letter media was your favorite youtuber's favorite youtube channel i'm
17:36
not sure how much money you can make on youtube at this time but for red letter media at least who i know had a huge
17:41
dedicated fan base their patreon was at least twenty thousand dollars a month for a time and i remember because i
17:47
contributed to for lindsay i'm not so sure but the key thing is that not only was this format unique it was also
17:54
popular it was lucrative and it was garnering a lot of attention and a lot
17:59
of copycats one subgenre of the algae formula that was able to do well was the
18:04
burgeoning skeptic community these auggies weren't yelling about video games or movies that much at least but
18:11
they were still very much in that augie pattern and their fan base was greatly shared with the likes of nostalgia
18:17
critic red letter media etc everybody probably except for lindsay ellis early on their content was focused around
18:23
critiquing culture and communities around religion and i want you to remember that because this community is going to be very important very soon
18:30
but the thing i'm just bringing them up for now is to understand that there was like a domino effect and suddenly
18:36
youtube was saturated with these commentary channels of edge lords and neck beards and i'm sure
18:43
very nice white men yelling about various things on the internet and the fans that came for that
18:50
became the base for a particular section of youtube's content consumption in the
18:56
early mid 2010s youtube began tweaking their algorithm to reward watch time as a metric for engagement instead of
19:02
virality and this is because if you think about it youtube's goal was to sell ad space for their videos but a
19:09
video going viral because it was so funny but only a minute long share it all through facebook or some other place
19:15
was not really bringing people back to youtube to sit and watch so what they started doing was promoting these
19:21
content creators that could make these long engaging videos even if the videos were just them standing in front of a
19:28
green wall talking now actually truth it was even less than that like some of these [ __ ] were just making
19:34
wave forms or still images and that was the whole thing some of these people are still doing that to this day but we'll
19:40
come to that in a second so this made prank channels and skit channels get less and less opportunity to be big on
19:47
the platform and on the flip side for those people who could regularly crank out content that was 10 20 minutes long
19:55
that a listenership would sit there and listen to and or watch that made them get boosted to the top
20:01
and coming back to those skeptics if you could make people angry or upset with what you were saying if you get stoked
20:08
outraged then you know based on recent things with facebook and twitter that this is some of the easiest
20:14
way to fuel social engagement so as an unfortunate byproduct of youtube's intense homogeneity of whiteness and
20:20
mildness there was this bubbling undercurrent of ugly negativity misogyny
20:25
racism and general awfulness that was always pretty clear below the surface but nobody was taking it seriously
20:32
because it was just a bunch of nerves on the internet yelling about star wars but what we didn't realize is just how deep
20:40
the discontent in fury was in this community so these guys weren't just angry about how bad the new star wars
20:46
movie was they were also angry that their home towns were riding after 20-plus years of desertion by american
20:52
economics and politics in favor of global capitalism they were angry because the religions they were taught growing up did not protect them from
20:58
social ostracism and bullying as children but now expects their obedience and dedication as adults they were mad
21:05
at 9 11 because it happened during their youth and it broke the world in their eyes as they had to realize the world
21:11
was much more complex ugly and dangerous than they were told growing up they weren't just angry about video games
21:17
they were angry about late capitalism but they didn't quite get that that was a
21:24
little too complex of a narrative to follow so they
21:29
just landed on muslims immigrants black people and women that was the problem
21:34
and so on so they became reactionaries but we didn't
21:40
know that at the time at the time we just thought they were angry video game nerds this reactionary
21:46
energy of this wing of youtube but also sites like the chan boards reddit the escapists and tons of message boards
21:53
that are relatively unknown was really bad and really volatile just waiting for
21:58
something to set it all they didn't know it but they were looking for a unifying target to point all of this rage and
22:06
discontent and anger at and as soon as they got it to be frank it changed the world or at
22:13
least the internet [Music]
22:21
have you ever noticed that with a few notable exceptions basically all female characters in video games fall into a
22:26
small handful of cliches and stereotypes when anita sarkeesian announced that kickstarted to fund a series of video
22:32
essays examining video games through a feminist lens the destructive power of this seemingly harmless group of edge
22:37
lords began to really show itself sarkeesian became a rallying cry for them to focus on and she experienced one
22:44
of the first major mass harassment campaigns of the modern social media era channels exploded solely off hating her
22:52
many of them established skeptic communities that stopped talking about religion and the silliness of
22:57
conservative or liberal politics and just started being against sjw's it was the rise of
23:03
the anti-sjw youtuber and because they could easily do this for 20 minutes and because it
23:09
was all negative vitriol youtube drove traffic to them and those channels grew
23:14
and not just in money and power and influence but also reach and in a few years they would follow up the anita
23:21
sarkeesian hate with gamergate gamergate was an awful social media campaign that took the harassment tactics used against
23:28
sarkeesian to another level and just generally made the internet the awful and ugly place it kind of is today what
23:34
these groups realize is that this anger and frustration was useful for creating
23:39
movements and money and you didn't have to have good ideas you didn't have to have solutions you didn't have to
23:45
actually address the problem as long as you made the sjws really really angry as long as you triggered
23:53
the libs and what they recognized is that nobody triggered the libs like donald trump and so trump became a folk
24:00
hero in this regard that basically galvanize all this energy and hatred
24:06
into a political movement that culminated in becoming president of the united states at the same time though
24:12
you could argue that the election of donald trump was the beginning to the end of this anti-sjw era that went from
24:18
about 2011 2012 to 2016-17 see the grifters and the creators made
24:25
the grievous mistake of actually winning their rhetoric which was at once oppositional to the status quo became
24:32
the status quo and now they had to actually lead and govern which we immediately saw they were not prepared
24:38
to do and at the same time finally people on the left started coming out of their shock state and realized that this
24:46
festering cesspool that had existed unfettered on youtube and other social media spaces was maybe in need of some
24:53
dire attention and for youtube at least i think this came to a head earlier than other social media entities like
24:59
facebook is just starting to get criticism for the way they stole negativity from the january 6 riots
25:05
twitter still clearly does not give a [ __ ] about negativity but in 2017 with the unite the right march
25:12
in charlottesville that ended at least one person dead in several violent brutal beatings by white supremacists on
25:18
people in the streets people started to point the finger at youtube and say hey uh how the [ __ ] did this happen it seems
25:25
like all these guys met each other watching videos that they found on your content platform this caused you to put
25:31
in more effort for reducing the spread of disinformation and radicalization content on the platform they reduced the
25:38
spread of content that was clearly inciting violence or violent rhetoric or spreading disinformation and things like
25:45
that and what they also did is start to amplify content that was research based
25:50
and science based and that had the side effect of amplifying the sjw channels
25:56
and here's where we finally get to the origins of bread tube slash left tube driven by the benefit of their content
26:01
being more factually based as well as an audience thirsty for alternative views and less outrage and nonsense along with
26:08
a sense of urgency in these communities to speak up for marginalized people and reduce the pull of radicalization on
26:15
their nieces and nephews combined with to be honest more talent
26:21
expertise better production values etc the algorithm boosted these channels so
26:28
creators like h bomber guy contra points big joel street arrows all made their way to the platform and
26:34
were met with not immediate success but definitely pretty quick success as these channels within a matter of a couple of
26:41
years became some of the most prominent channels and voices on the platform furthermore creators that had been there
26:47
for years kind of just middling in the middle ground of success like lindsey ellis but also creators like destiny and
26:53
philosophytube saw significant increases in their channel's size and reach these folks and other creators carved out a
27:00
unique space on youtube as education creators making video essays about media and philosophy and social commentary on
27:07
important and often political subjects or streaming and reacting to other leftist content and that became the
27:13
origins of bread too but the key thing is if you watch especially the earliest renditions of
27:20
these types of channels their intended goal was directly engaging in de-radicalization and rehabilitation of
27:28
the variety of young and impressionable white mostly male minds affected by four
27:33
or five years of unfetter radicalization under the anti-sjw skeptic community
27:39
wave that same fan base that was introduced to consuming youtube content with the angry video game nerd and
27:44
nostalgia critic and regular media have been sitting and being fed essentially fascist propaganda for years now and
27:52
they were definitely in need of a good cleaning and it worked and it also made
27:57
the community as a whole maybe a little more diverse at least in terms of gender and sexuality leftist ideals became much
28:04
more prominent and held much more value in explaining social issues this was reflected in the rise of people like
28:10
bernie sanders and aoc becoming significant pop culture figures as opposed to politicians for espousing
28:17
what would have been seen as extreme ideologies 10 20 years ago but now they were mainstream leftist superstars
28:24
regardless of how you feel about them now it was a huge paradigm shift in only a few years like literally three
28:31
but something was wrong despite the fact that it was working that this audience had become more diverse and a little
28:37
more erratic alive but because much of the audience was grown out of this need to reverse the pull of right-wing
28:43
conservatism and semi-fascist ideology and white supremacy in this population
28:48
of millennials and young zoomers that have been watching this [ __ ] for years this diversity wasn't really reflected
28:55
in the creators pretty much at all and to be frank like the people of color that was watching
29:01
this content although they were very much invested in progressive ideas and politics they weren't so scared that
29:07
their younger cousin was going to become a neo-nazi insult because they had been hanging around on our politics and
29:12
watching amazing atheist videos so in the following years as the anti-sjw channel has lost a lot of steam as a
29:19
content formula and the august have started to become more quiet and these creators have seen their channel growth
29:25
crash to a halt and their views shrink we have inversely seen the rise of the leftist youtube but what we haven't seen
29:30
is a real manifestation of leftist ideology be reflected outside of white
29:36
western world view but i don't want to papoo the fact that people like contra points and philosophy tube and three
29:42
arrows were successful in doing something very important which was reversing the pull of radicalism on
29:48
these communities it's just that i'm kind of starting to wonder if there's anything else left for those
29:56
creators to do and where do creators that look like me that come from my background fit into
30:03
this equation both philosophically and economically so before i move on i just
30:09
want to make sure three things are understood the long-form video essay format what
30:14
i'm doing right now is a fundamental genre of con's creation on youtube and
30:20
it's important because it's taken the place of like the news editorial or vh1
30:25
documentaries and long-form think pieces that were indelible to my youth growing up but now for another generation
30:33
they're going to remember this they're going to remember these videos as the thought pieces that shape their world
30:38
view so regardless of how many people watch this and how much money i make from it and whether or not i'm talking
30:44
about this or anime this is important and because this is important it's just
30:49
as important that this isn't dominated by one world view or perspective of the world the second thing to understand is
30:55
that from an economic standpoint brad tube and leftist youtube has created its own rabbit hole through which youtube
31:01
can funnel views and traffic which also means eyeballs and ad dollars so
31:06
now we do have a talented second wave of leftist youtubers so guys like thought slime and sean were able to come on and
31:13
grow pretty significantly and make waves and then you have people like solari john the duncan that were able to follow
31:19
suit as long as you are a white guy and you're willing to go through the rite of passage that is making your anti-ben
31:25
shapiro video you will have the opportunity to make money and sustain a career as a leftist
31:31
content creator and like all shade assad because i [ __ ] with almost everybody i just mentioned there this is an
31:36
important thing it's important for new voices and younger voices and voices of more energy that are willing to innovate
31:43
to come and grab the consistently growing population of consumers on the
31:49
channel for people to attach to these creators and hopefully they're able to cultivate not just a career but cultural
31:57
impact with these important topics that they talk about but as i'm clearly alluding to the bread
32:03
tuber and its consumers definitely fit a specific description one in which
32:09
youtube clearly recognizes not as a social movement or political ideology
32:15
but a target demographic and because that demographic is largely white and largely male and not an insignificant
32:21
amount of those people that are in that demographic are low-key recovering from being white supremacists and fascists
32:28
that means a lot to how any content creator that doesn't look like the homie
32:33
noah samson can get on this platform and regardless of their level of talent
32:38
expertise in making content go from being pretty much unknown
32:45
to having one of these but i just want to be clear here i don't have this plaque because i'm so
32:51
good at making youtube videos i don't have this plaque because i joined the illuminati
32:56
i have this plaque because i got lucky because i followed a trend and made a video that was better than most
33:02
everybody else making videos on that particular topic and finally after a year of toiling in
33:09
the hellscape that is small channel purgatory i got to this level and the
33:14
fact that i was very much ready to quit because i didn't think that i had what it takes makes me think about how many other
No Favors From the Algorithm
33:21
people that looked like me that may have had talent or at least talent good enough on par with some of my white
33:27
peers didn't get to this point this is the thing so i never saw
33:33
a black creator i'm just going to be honest a racialized black creator or even a not just a
33:38
non-white creator in general doing that sort of video essay intellectual analysis whatever for me i was just like
33:45
okay i genuinely didn't even know how to lo","After a few months of “success” on the platform, I sat to contemplate my journey from unknown content creator scraping for views to hot new video essayist and legit “left tuber”.  This contemplation led to numerous questions and ponderings, and as I dived into those questions I started to get frustrated the answers that I arrived at.  I got tired of people asking me “where have you been this whole time” when I knew I had been just quietly treading water, wondering why my videos weren’t being seen, and wondering why I barely saw any creators in the mold of what I wanted to do.

To explore these emotions, I talked to a variety of creators and experts on the nature of YouTube as a media platform the algorithmic systems that govern it, and the greater culture around it.  I  delved into my own concerns and observations about the landscape of YouTube, especially “left tube”.

This video is my thesis on what challenges I and other black creators face.

(pulsing music)
0:05
- [Jon] It's the final game of the season for the 1998 Toronto Blue Jays. This franchise has managed to patch together their first
0:12
winning season in years with a team that's kind of a traveling circus. They have a manager who inspires them by telling them
0:17
war stories from his tour in Vietnam. He'll soon be fired after it's found out that he never went to Vietnam
0:22
and he made all those stories up. But that's neither here nor there. The Jays also have a ton of star power. Even if you don't follow baseball at all,
0:29
the names Roger Clemens and Jose Canseco probably ring a bell. But on this Sunday afternoon, the celebrity is somebody totally unexpected.
0:36
As of 1:00 PM local time, he was a mostly unknown rookie pitching in just his second career game.
0:41
By 2:45 PM, he has become the most famous man in Toronto. He is the Jays' 21-year-old right-hander, Roy Halladay.
0:50
(intense music)
0:56
- [Alex] With just one inning to go until hibernating for the winter, Halladay's poised to make history.
1:02
25 times a batter has squared off against him, and not once did any legitimately reach base.
1:09
On 24 occasions, the batter was retired, with Tigers first baseman Tony Clark getting aboard once on an error.
1:16
Halladay is therefore on the verge of tossing Major League Baseball's 248th all-time no-hitter.
1:23
A no-hitter is defined as pitching an entire game of at least nine innings without allowing any hits.
1:30
(intense music)
1:35
It's a feat so rare that many of the greatest pitchers of all time have never completed one.
1:41
Whenever any pitcher, anywhere in the world, steps on the mound and sets to throw their first pitch,
1:47
some small part of them always wonders whether this will be the day. With Halladay three outs away,
1:53
the first batter he faces is Gabe Kapler, who promptly flies out. Then Deivi Cruz is lifted in favor of pinch hitter
2:01
Paul Bako, who hits an easy ground ball for out number 26.
2:07
Halladay is one out away. Butterfly effect aside, one could argue were it not for the aforementioned error
2:14
that put Tony Clark on base, Bako's grounder would've been out number 27.
2:19
So at this moment, the game is simply not over when it otherwise would be.
2:24
In steps another pinch hitter, left-handed slugger Bobby Higginson.
2:29
(intense music) Everyone in Toronto holds their breath
2:34
as Halladay fires a first pitch fastball headed straight toward the outer half of the plate.
2:41
(intense music) - [Jon] A home run is a hell of a way to lose a no-hitter. Forget about making history,
2:46
you don't even have a shutout anymore. But this baseball has far more important matters to attend to.
2:51
You see, Higginson is late to bring his bat around. Maybe it's because he sat on the bench all day and his eyes are still gettin' used to the speed of the ball.
2:58
Maybe it's because he doesn't expect Halladay to have this much gas in the tank this late in the game. Whatever the case, he smacks it to the opposite field.
3:05
(wooden bat smacks ball) Higginson is decidedly not an opposite-field hitter.
3:12
He'll hit quite a lot of homers over the course of his career, but as is typical for hitters, he hits the ball hardest when he gets a little bit ahead of it.
3:18
He's a left-handed batter, hence, his homers just about always end up flying over the right field fence, with a few veering toward right-center.
3:24
Across his entire 11-year career, only seven of his home runs, that's about 3% of 'em,
3:29
will be hit directly to left field, and this is one of those seven. So maybe this is dumb luck. Or maybe
3:36
this baseball knows exactly where it needs to go. At the very end of the very last game of the season,
3:42
it has no time to waste. It's on its way to pay a visit to an old friend. Halladay's teammates in the bullpen watch in agony
3:48
as his no-hitter vaporizes over their heads. Only one of them possesses the spiritual fortitude to turn around and take in the entire show.
3:56
Dave Stieb has about 90 seconds left in a Major League Baseball career that began almost 20 years ago.
4:01
Consider the slim odds of this ball ending up on this side of the field to begin with, and then consider the near-impossibility of this no-hitter
4:09
splattering against the wall, and caroming perfectly into Stieb's hands. It was saying goodbye to the man who, at his best,
4:15
had understood it as well as anybody. Dave Stieb knows more about no-hitters than any other baseball player who has ever lived.

5:26
It's 1982. Dave Stieb has pitched in Toronto for four years, and he's pretty fond of it.
5:31
Growing up in California, he was so singularly dedicated to polishing his own baseball skills that he didn't follow Major League Baseball happenings all that closely,
5:38
to the extent that he was only barely aware there were teams in Canada now. But he's come to love the fans in Toronto,
5:44
who he finds less obnoxious than other fan bases, but no less proud. (funky music)
5:54
The Toronto Blue Jays are one of just two Canadian teams, and a losing season does nothing to dent their national pride.
6:00
Besides, it's to be expected. The Jays are a very new franchise, having been founded in 1977, and new franchises lose a lot.
6:07
Stieb, who landed here in 1979, has a less easy time with it. He's a perfectionist who wants to win,
6:13
badly, and all of the time. On September 6th in Oakland, he's getting his wish.
6:18
He's taken a no-hitter into the 7th inning. When, exactly, you start wondering about a no-hitter varies from fan to fan.
6:24
Personally speaking, if I hear you've got a no-hitter going in the 5th, I'll keep a browser tab open for you. If you've got one going in the 7th?
6:31
I'm gonna turn on the game. Stieb's opponents, the Oakland Athletics, are having an off year, but he does have some dangerous hitters
6:37
to find a way around. Job one has been to keep Rickey Henderson off base, and it's not an easy one.
6:43
Over the course of his career, Stieb will hold the hitters of the American League to a .667 OPS, but Rickey has far better luck against him.
6:50
The two will meet each other exactly 100 times in the regular season, and the differences between the two can be seen
6:55
in their pregame rituals. Rickey stands naked in front of a mirror and stares at himself while telling himself ""Rickey's the best"" over and over.
7:02
Stieb eats a tuna sandwich. Rickey's genius and athleticism make him one of the most disruptive, dangerous opponents
7:08
baseball has ever seen. He's incredible at finding some means or another to get on first, and once he's there
7:13
he dances his ass off as he threatens to steal second base. He's such a distraction for your average pitcher that
7:18
it's probably tempting just to let him have second and be done with it. Today, Stieb has managed to circumvent this problem entirely
7:23
by popping Rickey out all three times. Stieb did issue a few walks early on, but in a no-hitter,
7:29
things like walks, errors, and hit batsmen are allowed, meaning his masterpiece is intact by the time he faces power hitter Tony Armas
7:35
with one out in the seventh. Having set down 19 Oakland hitters, he only needs to get eight more out
7:40
to achieve the first no-hitter in Toronto Blue Jays history. Unfortunately for him, and for us, and for you,
7:47
Stieb is just about to blow it. But he's going to tell us a lot about who he is,
7:52
both as a pitcher and as a human being, in the specific manner in which he blows it. - [Alex] Stieb quickly gets ahead in the count
7:59
1-2 when his catcher, Geno Petralli, signals for a fastball. With two of 'em in his repertoire,
8:05
the more effective is his two-seamer, which he throws with a velocity reaching the mid-90s
8:11
and has biting movement. He starts it off generally right down the middle before letting it find its way to the edge of the plate
8:19
at the last moment. (crowd cheers) - [Announcer] He gets Valdez, his fourth strikeout. - [Alex] The other is his four-seamer,
8:26
which lacks movement and requires more pinpoint control. - [Announcer] He throws a strike.
8:31
- [Alex] While he throws fastballs about half the time, Dave's not interested in bringing the heat right now
8:36
and shakes off his catcher, who then calls for a curveball. Constituting about 10% of his pitches,
8:42
Stieb's got two of these in his bag as well. One is slow, in the 80mph range,
8:48
and breaks downward as it approaches the plate. - [Announcer] Got 'em! (crowd cheers) - [Alex] His hard curve is close to 90mph
8:55
with a bit more of a sidearm delivery that makes it break across the plate. But once again, Stieb shakes his head.
9:03
Fine, now Petralli wants him to throw his money pitch: his slider. This is a pitch Stieb throws about a third of the time
9:10
and comes off appearing like a fastball before breaking sharply down and to the left.
9:16
It simply ruins hitters' days. Royals Hall of Famer George Brett described it as wicked,
9:23
and iconic baseball journalist Peter Gammons had previously ranked it as the second-best in the league.
9:29
But for the third time, Stieb shakes off his catcher. There's only one choice left:
9:35
Petralli delivers the sign for a changeup. Tossed by Stieb only about once every 14 pitches
9:41
to keep hitters off balance, it's meant to dupe 'em into thinking a fastball's coming, only to wind up hitting the radar gun in the 70s.
9:50
Stieb coined it 'the dead fish' as its lack of velocity sorta just caused it to flop down late toward the dirt.
9:57
Stieb's figuring Armas is sitting dead red expecting fastball and wants to leverage that.
10:03
But even though this is just Petralli's second career start and first time ever catching for Stieb,
10:09
he knew what he was doing with his initial call for a fastball. Having previously competed against Armas in winter ball,
10:16
Petralli knows that especially when behind in the count, Armas loves sitting on the changeup.
10:22
Oblivious to this, it also doesn't help matters when Stieb leaves the ball right over the middle of the plate
10:28
where one big swing from Armas sends it flying into the outfield bleachers, ripping both the no-hitter and the shutout
10:35
from Stieb's grasp in one fell swoop. (door shutting)
10:41
- [Jon] The way he was pitching today, he really might have locked up this no-hitter if only he'd listened to his catcher.
10:46
But Dave Stieb is a guy who, at this point in his career, feels like he knows everything. And frankly, if you know how he became a pitcher
10:53
and when he became a pitcher, it's hard to blame him. In college, Stieb was unquestionably the best player
10:58
on the Southern Illinois Salukis roster. Thing was, he was strictly an outfielder. He broke the school record for home runs
11:04
and hit close to .400, but he was not a pitcher, nor had he ever pitched at any point in high school.
11:10
There's almost no precedent for this. Bob Lemon, one of the few who achieved no-hitter immortality, famously didn't even learn how to pitch
11:16
until he was already a professional baseball player, but that was way back in the 1940s. This is the late-'70s, the modern era,
11:23
in which pitchers have at least some idea they're gonna be a pitcher by the time they're 12. But here we have 20-year-old Dave Stieb,
11:29
who's never even considered the possibility of pitching, until one day in spring of 1978.
11:35
Southern Illinois has a doubleheader coming up, and they're short on rested arms in the bullpen to the extent that they resort to desperate measures.
11:41
They just round up all the outfielders and see who can throw the hardest. Turns out, it's Stieb. The pitching coach gives him a crash course
11:48
in how to throw a slider, a pitch that typically takes years and years to master. Stieb gives it a couple tries in practice
11:54
and it immediately becomes clear that he has the best slider on the team. So they shove him out there to pitch a couple innings
11:59
and fill a job that typically requires a decade of in-game experience. With literally zero in-game experience,
12:06
Stieb sits down all seven of the batters he faces. His slider is estimated at 89mph,
12:12
with his fastball thought to be moving at 97. There were and are many, many major-league pitchers
12:17
who can't approach that velocity. Stieb had a missile launcher attached to his right shoulder and he never even knew it.
12:23
The time is ripe for shenanigans! A few scouts from Major League Baseball just happen to be attending this game,
12:29
and Blue Jays scout Al LaMacchia out-maneuvers all of 'em. He immediately sows doubt amongst scouts from other teams,
12:35
saying that this outfielder just happened to luck out on the mound against a bunch of stiffs and that he'd never be able to do it again.
12:40
He doesn't know anything about conditioning, he hasn't built up arm strength or pitching instincts. Projecting him as a pitcher is ridiculous.
12:46
It's a pretty strong case, and LaMacchia's fellow scouts seem to buy it. He's duped 'em all.
12:51
LaMacchia picks up the phone and calls Toronto, and two months later, Dave Stieb is pitching in the Blue Jays' farm system.
12:58
His coaches at Southern Illinois wanted him to stick around for one more year. You know, spend just a little more time
13:03
learning what being a pitcher is actually like, polish your repertoire, and improve your prospects in the draft.
13:08
That's certainly the most reasonable path. But this is an early opportunity to get to know Dave Stieb.
13:13
He does not compromise, wait, or even slow down, for better or for worse, ever.
13:19
He doesn't want to be great. He's already internalized that he is great, and he simply needs the rest of the world
13:25
to catch up with him. Entering the minor leagues is the most direct route to what he correctly believes is his destination as an
13:31
ace starting pitcher in Major League Baseball. He'd pitched in his first-ever game a couple of months ago.
13:36
He was still, by his own admission, learning how to pitch. His appraisal of what he was capable of
13:41
was completely absurd. He was also absolutely correct. In '79, he's promoted to AAA-Syracuse;
13:48
halfway through that '79 season, the organization has seen enough and promotes him to the big-league roster.
13:53
And that's where he stays for good. 13 months after stepping on a mound for the first time in his life,
13:58
Dave Stieb is a major league starter. No one does this. Let's take in the sample of all the rookie pitchers
14:05
who first broke into the bigs in '79. In black, you see the number of innings they logged in the minors, and in white, you see how many major-league innings
14:11
they pitched in their first five seasons until they were sent back down. Which, in the vast majority of cases, they were.
14:17
It's typical for pitchers, even guys who end up as great pitchers, to bounce up and down a couple times while they develop.
14:22
(Jon chuckles) Not Stieb, whose innings pitched in his first five seasons are a huge outlier in this sample.
14:27
Stieb spent just 128 innings in the minors. Now, these five guys, the only five
14:33
who spent fewer innings in the minors than Stieb? It should be noted that while Stieb only pitched a couple of times in college,
14:38
they had pitched all throughout college, and surely throughout high school as well. Surely all these other guys did, in fact.
14:44
Look at all these others who toiled in the minors for hundreds and hundreds of innings, finally got their shot, and appeared in the bigs only briefly
14:51
before being demoted. The depths of their lifetime pitching experience go far deeper than what we're seeing here.
14:56
Imagine if these were trees we were looking at. What if you dug up the tallest tree in the woods and discovered the roots were only a foot deep?
15:03
It just doesn't make any sense. Unless you choose to believe you are the master of the universe.
15:09
That's the only real way to square it, I think, if you're Dave Stieb. And that is the thinking that leads you to blow a no-hitter
15:15
by shaking off your catcher's signs three different times because you, and only you, have been right all along.
15:20
But again, can't really blame him for feeling like he knows what nobody else does. See, in these early years,
15:26
Stieb wasn't merely good enough to stick around. He was, in fact, one of the best pitchers of in baseball.
15:32
He knew this. But the people responsible for handing out awards did not. - [Alex] For starters, these people struggled immensely
15:39
to separate individual performance from team success. And while the extent to which team success should be weighed
15:46
in an award like MVP is debatable, that's not really the case for MLBs most prestigious
15:52
annual honor designated for pitchers, the Cy Young Award. It's an award that's supposed to simply go
15:58
to the most outstanding pitcher in each league, but history is littered with outrageous Cy Young voting results,
16:05
and arguably no one has gotten as consistently disrespected in that arena as Dave Stieb.
16:12
Throughout his first four years in Toronto, the Blue Jays were the most dreadful team in MLB.
16:17
As such, he had a much more difficult time than other pitchers in racking up individual wins,
16:23
Which is heavily reliant upon run support generated by the pitcher's teammates. For instance, when Stieb was called up to the bigs in '79,
16:31
he joined a squad that would go on to drop over two-thirds of their games. Their 109 losses were the most by any team in the '70s
16:40
and the most any team would lose again for nearly a quarter-century. And even if you do want to talk individual wins,
16:47
the only reason the Jays were that good was because of this 22-year-old kid in the first full pitching season
16:53
of his life who did still win half of his 16 decisions for the worst single-season baseball team of a generation.
17:01
The next year he took a step forward, even earning a birth in the MLB All-Star Game. Perhaps he wasn't quite yet among the very top tier
17:09
of the American League's pitchers -- I suppose a forgivable offense given he'd been plying his new trade for about as long as
17:16
one of Larry King's first few marriages -- but that was starting to change. And even though that continued to change into 1981,
17:24
the recognition did not. There are two names in particular that are pure embarrassments to have in lieu of Stieb here.
17:31
One is Goose Gossage, who as lovely as his rate metrics were, only had 'em thanks to pitching fewer than 50 innings.
17:39
The other is Pete Vuckovich, whose three more wins than Stieb thanks to the irrelevant-to- pitching-superior-run-support
17:46
he received from his playoff team, apparently way more than offsets the fact that Stieb pitched significantly more innings
17:53
and had a significantly better ERA, metrics that even back then they had at their disposal.
17:59
It makes no sense. Let's make it make less sense. Welcome to the future.
18:07
(dance music) - [Jon] Wins Above Replacement, or WAR for short. Has it enhanced our enjoyment of the game of baseball?
18:14
(Jon winces) (dance music) Has it given us more bullshit to complain about?
18:20
ABSOLUTELY. WAR is an estimation of how many more wins a team has because they have this guy on their team
18:25
instead of some replacement level bozo. No offense intended toward any bozos who might be watching. There are a few variations of this metric,
18:31
but we'll use the Baseball-Reference model. WAR has been in the lab since the 1990s, but it didn't really gain traction until
18:37
well after guys like Stieb retired. It offers a more complete picture of his accomplishments in retrospect.
18:42
Now, the same things that make up ERA do factor heavily into this, but so do a lot of other things. How tough were the pitcher's opponents
18:48
at that point in history? Did the pitcher's home stadium have particularly friendly or unfriendly dimensions?
18:53
How well did the pitcher perform in more important, pivotal situations? Things like that. Of course, there's no one number
18:59
that can ever give you the full measure of a player, and advanced metrics are in a constant state of evolution. 20 years from now, we'll probably use formulas
19:05
that look a little bit different. But WAR is a pretty amazing metric, and it's the best tool we have to illustrate how great Dave Stieb really was.
19:13
- [Alex] With the benefit of hindsight and advanced metrics, we also see that Stieb's WAR more than doubled that of Vuckovich.
19:20
And despite again pitching for MLB's worst team, Stieb again was able to overcome that
19:26
as he personally posted a winning record, even though that shouldn't matter here. Finally, in 1982,
19:32
Stieb got the very first Cy Young votes of his career. Yet the results were just as perplexing
19:39
as to how not one, not two, but three players could've finished ahead of the league's top workhorse
19:46
who lapped the field in WAR, including nearly tripling Vuckovich, who must know where all the bodies are buried or something
19:54
as this time he actually won the dang thing. Here's another way to frame what a travesty it was
20:00
for Vuckovich to win. In 1982 the average American League hitter had an OPS of .730 -- but specifically when facing Vuckovich?
20:09
That figure rose to .740. Folks collectively hit better than they usually did
20:15
when facing the guy who'd ultimately win the award that's supposed to go to the most outstanding pitcher.
20:21
That's not how this is supposed to work. I'm afraid it only gets uglier as we move into 1983.
20:30
That year's starting pitcher in the All-Star Game, Stieb was completely shut out in Cy Young voting.
20:36
This despite having a better ERA than not only any of the five starting pitchers
20:42
who did get votes, but also any AL pitcher who tossed at least 180 innings.
20:48
And he had nearly 280, second-most in the league. That helped catapult his WAR to heights that
20:55
for the second year in a row towered over the rest of the league. And he wasn't even playing
21:01
for a losing organization anymore: Stieb was the best player on a team that finished 16 games over .500.
21:08
But LaMarr Hoyt, thanks to the siren song of some more individual wins while playing for a division champ,
21:14
took home the award despite finishing third on his own team's starting rotation in WAR.
21:20
And Stieb somehow received not even one single scrap of the leftover voting.
21:28
- [Jon] You know what's even more damning about all of this? These 28 writers all fill out a ranked ballot.
21:34
They don't just vote for one guy, they're allowed a 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-place vote. And in 1980, '81 and most egregiously '83,
21:42
not a single one of those 28 voters could shake loose even one 3rd-place vote for our buddy Dave.
21:49
This sucks. The hell with this. Let's go to Disney World. (funky music)
22:00
Stieb is in an interesting spot. The likes of Andre Dawson and Gary Carter are royalty all throughout Quebec, of course.
22:06
But in Ontario, the prairies, and even parts of BC, the Toronto Blue Jays are by and large the team.
22:12
And Stieb, being the Blue Jays' first true star is the standard-bearer who often has to do all the standard-bearing things.
22:19
One of those things is a promotional trip to Disney World. I want to show you this because I think it's important to at least see some version of Dave Stieb
22:25
that isn't as told by baseball writers, who by and large do not like him. Here he and his catcher, Ernie Whitt, are flown down
22:32
from actual Canada to the Epcot Center to take in a ... virtual Canada. Look, Dave! It's some land!
22:39
- A lotta open land. - [Jon] He's then whisked away to the American exhibit to virtually experience the magical land
22:44
known as the United States, where he has lived his entire life and also is currently located.
22:52
(Jon groans) - [Jon] I'm so bored.
22:58
I can only imagine how bored he must be. But look at that smile through gritted teeth. He's really trying.
23:05
That's the thing to know: yes, Stieb is often cranky, but he's trying to rise to the occasion of serving as a Canadian hero.
23:11
He's working on it. Sometimes he fails. In particular, he has a frankly shitty habit of throwing his teammates under the bus
23:17
when things don't go his way. In 1981, after left fielder Al Woods misplayed a ball and cost Stieb a couple of runs,
23:22
Stieb threw a full-blown temper tantrum on the mound. Though it went unsaid, it's easy to guess that Stieb,
23:28
who was a star outfielder himself just three years prior, didn't see what was all that hard about it. But showing up your teammates,
23:33
the fielders who you as a pitcher rely upon to have your back, is one of baseball's cardinal offenses.
23:39
It's something you just do not do. Unless you're Stieb, who stares daggers at Woods
23:44
and even throws his glove in the air in exasperation. He'd been at it the whole inning, throwing fits after misplaced pitches
23:49
and glaring at his fellow pitchers warming up in the bullpen, as if to say, ""don't you dare come out here.""
23:54
It was such a spectacle that even his opponents took note, with Rangers manager Don Zimmer saying his behavior was total horseshit.
24:01
The consensus is building very quickly throughout baseball that Dave Stieb is an asshole.
24:06
Several incidents reinforced this image, including another fit in 1982 that nearly ended in a fistfight.
24:11
After giving up a home run, Stieb blamed catcher Buck Martinez for calling the wrong pitch, throwing up his arms and cussing him out.
24:17
As a pitcher, your catcher is your co-pilot. He's your only friend. Making the offense even more egregious,
24:23
Martinez is one of the Blue Jays' elder statesmen, a respected veteran who's been catching since the sixties.
24:28
It boiled over in the dugout, and even the next day, Martinez was looking for a fight. Stieb apologized,
24:34
just as he'd apologized to Woods the year prior. He knew he'd messed up. But the cement has already dried on this reputation,
24:40
and it's a reputation he'll always have trouble overcoming. Sportswriters typically chalk this up to his hypercompetitive nature,
24:46
and although Stieb absolutely was hypercompetitive, I think that explanation's too easy. There are plenty of monomaniacal athletes
24:52
who manage to avoid taking it out on their teammates. I think this is more of a story of a man who did not tolerate limits.
24:58
To get here, he marched right through those limits without hesitation, as though they were invisible, and amazingly, they were!
25:04
The rule that said you couldn't start learning how to pitch until after your 20th birthday? Not real. Did not exist.
25:10
He hit the gas, rocketing right through the minor leagues, into the majors, into the role of #1 starter and All-Star pitcher in a two-year masterclass evisceration
25:18
of conventional wisdom. I mean, if you wanna be exact, two years, two months and two days. Now, Stieb was learning that the rules are, in fact,
25:25
very real. They're just further down the pike than one might have expected. Stieb, a starting pitcher who only took the ball
25:32
once every four or five games, couldn't will the Toronto Blue Jays into a winning ballclub. He had zero influence over how much run support
25:38
they gave him, and therefore, how many wins he could stack up. That, in turn, resulted in him getting completely snubbed out of recognition
25:44
in the form of a Cy Young Award. He should have won two at the bare minimum. In his own words, he was ""jobbed.""
25:49
With the benefit of advanced metrics he probably never could have imagined would come one day, we know his gut feeling was absolutely right.
25:57
All of this fell into yet, another domino: money. (jazz music)
26:05
Stieb wants $350,000 a year. The Blue Jays want to pay him $250,000,
26:10
or about $700,000 in today's money. Which is a ton of money, unless Stieb blows out his arm
26:16
and he has to spread that $700,000 over the next 50 years or so, in which case 14,000 bucks a year,
26:21
before both American and Canadian taxes, would be his take from an All-Star baseball career. That's not great for Dave and Pattie, who recently married
26:28
and are trying to start a family together. The move would be to hit the open market, but the rules prevent a player from entering free agency
26:34
until he's played for six full seasons. For Stieb, who entered the bigs halfway through 1979, that realistically means waiting
26:40
until after the 1985 season, so the move instead is to enter arbitration. Here's how arbitration works:
26:46
both Stieb and the Jays present their case to a judge who serves as an independent arbitrator. That judge then rules in favor of one number or the other,
26:54
no in-between. Since this is Dave Stieb we're talking about, he loses unfairly and has to settle for the $250,000.
27:00
He's stunned, and he also reveals something pretty interesting. He says the Blue Jays made the case that statistically
27:06
he fell down the middle, that he was, in fact, a mediocre major league pitcher. Looking at modern metrics, that is an impossible conclusion to draw,
27:13
so let's roll out some of the more basic stats they had access to at the time. How could the Jays have possibly argued
27:19
that Stieb was mediocre? Not really in terms of ERA, in which he ranked 18th of 52 AL pitchers
27:25
to qualify for the ERA title in '81, and that's not even counting the 150 or so others who couldn't stick around long enough to qualify.
27:32
And definitely not in terms of innings pitched, in which he ranked 5th, which makes his earned run average all the more impressive.
27:37
WHIP, or walks and hits per inning pitched? 7th-best of 52. Strikeouts? Tied for 10th.
27:42
Wins, the a superficial stat that's a terrible reflection of actual value? Hey, even here, he ranked 12th.
27:48
We need an even dumber stat. The pitching win's even more useless son:
27:53
win-loss percentage. As a pitcher, you can pitch a great game and still earn the loss, happens all the time.
27:59
You can also parachute into a game, pitch one inning, and pick up a win if your offense happens to score at the right time.
28:04
Win-loss percentage is beyond irrelevant. And yet, it's the only statistical category in which Stieb,
28:09
who went 11-10, had a mediocre showing. This must have been the stat the Blue Jays cited.
28:15
That's cute. If you're a pitcher who ranks well above average in every other category, how do you lose games?
28:22
Poor run support. In 1981 the Blue Jays scored the very fewest runs in all of baseball by a decisive margin,
28:28
even fewer than National League teams that didn't even get the designated hitter. Meaning the Blue Jays leveraged their own incompetence
28:35
to successfully argue that their best player was nothing special. This is some bigtime loser behavior
28:41
on the part of this organization, all for the sake of 100,000 bucks. They won, although they might not have if even one writer
28:48
bothered to cast a vote that made him a Cy Young contender. That absence of logic is costing him money now.
28:54
And you say he's cranky, huh? (calm music)
28:59
An Associated Press story laments that he just got too good, too fast. These rules that restrict free agency
29:05
are in place to allow owners to do exactly this, to rob players of leverage. Stieb got here in the first place
29:11
by rejecting every status quo, and of course, he rejects this one too, saying out loud what every player feels.
29:17
From a distance, the inability of a player to determine which team he works for seems absurd, but even the ability
29:23
to do so after six years of service was an enormous victory for baseball's labor movement. Just 12 years prior,
29:28
Curt Flood had essentially sacrificed his career in his fight for free agency. In 1981, the players went on strike as a defensive maneuver
29:35
simply to preserve the sanctity of free agency that Flood had helped secure. It blew a hole right through the middle
29:40
of the baseball season, leaving MLB to slap together a new playoff format and reschedule the All-Star Game to August.
29:46
A lot of fans saw it as a joke. And Stieb's role in these proceedings was to serve as the butt of the joke.
29:51
American League manager Jim Frey mismanaged his roster so badly that night that he had to do something unthinkable in an All-Star Game:
29:58
- [Announcer] You're looking at another historical event. It's the first","“Who’s Dave Stieb?” you might be asking. Well, this is a guy who had never stepped on a pitcher’s mound in his life until age 20. Just four years later, he was the best pitcher in the American League. This is the beginning of the almost unbelievable story of the man who put the Toronto Blue Jays on the map.

some true blasts from the past the open nature of the pc as a platform

has made this kind of archival work and preservation a possibility but
1:08
this is only half of the story there is an entire domain of gaming history that has yet to be accounted for
1:15
and properly archived console gaming
1:20
[Music] these games are no less important to the history of the medium than their pc

1:50
of history and preservation and a crisis of art it's also a sign of just how young
1:56
gaming is as an artistic medium in that it's now experiencing the same preservation problems that plagued the
2:02
early years of film fritzlong's metropolis is one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever made and
2:09
full stop one of the most important films ever put to celluloid but for nearly a century there were no
2:14
high-quality masters of the film available anywhere only grainy and washed out reproductions
2:20
which were also missing about 30 minutes of footage it wasn't until a pristine reel was

2:33
hmm i guess the south american nazi hunters must have missed that one spring is not

just mine sure yeah yeah but unlike the early years of film
2:46
classic console gaming has its own problems that are totally unique to the medium the reliance on proprietary tech
2:52
like cartridges and system-specific game pads means that these older games aren't just difficult to preserve

they're nearly impossible to play on their original hardware unless you're a dedicated collector with thousands and

3:28
hundreds of dollars on the resale market there's no way at the moment to play these games legitimately

of copyright and ip is so busted counterproductive and hostile to art
4:03
it's a masterpiece of a cinematic 3d rpg that absolutely goes toe-to-toe with the
4:08
final fantasies and diablos of the era and it's a game that is dearly beloved by almost everyone who has had the good
4:15
fortune of playing it this game was highly regarded and well reviewed when it was released and yet
4:21
sold only a few thousand copies outside of japan this
4:26
is panzer dragoon saga [Music]
PART I: Age of Ruin
4:40
panzer dragoon saga is a continuation of the first two games in the series for the sega saturn panzer dragoon in 1995
4:48
and its prequel panzer dragoon's vi in 1996. these two games quickly became the
4:54
definitive killer apps for the saturn owing to their artful blend of epic narrative cutting-edge polygonal 3d
5:01
graphics and fast-paced on-rails shooting if star fox set the template for rail
5:06
shooters in the era of 90s console games then it was panzer dragoon that took this format and got weird with it
5:14
all three of the saturn's panzer dragoon games were developed by team andromeda an internal sega design team headed up
5:20
by series creator yukio futatsuki and futatsuki himself was a young and hungry novice when he started working on
5:27
the series only 23 years old with barely two years of experience at sega at the time
5:33
the young lads and lasses of team andromeda were as futatsuki put it during an interview at gdc 2019
5:40
punk rock game designers in creating panzer dragoon and its sequels they were also tackling the
5:46
era's game design conventions head on with the aim of creating something remarkable and totally new
5:53
taking off all of the first panzer dragoon's numerous technological and design accomplishments could easily be a
5:58
video essay all its own there's full 360 degree 3d camera control allowing the player to aim and
6:04
shoot in any direction the scenery is breathtaking including that cool ass water effect that at the
6:11
time only the saturn could do creating an endless asia ocean that is so
6:16
instantly evocative of those
6:21
[Music] and a lavishly animated dragon as the
6:28
player characters mount whose wings flap and glide through technicolor skies with its tail rolling and undulating in a
6:35
remarkably life-like display these games were a testament to the dual cpu horsepower the saturn was packing
6:41
underneath its unassuming exterior this was a notoriously difficult console to code for but with enough effort
6:48
dedicated devs like team andromeda could work magic while the sequel's vi would make some
6:53
interesting additions to the formula like branching levels and a progression system in the form of evolutions for
6:59
your dragon it was essentially a bigger and better sequel to the first panzer dragoon
7:04
but the next game in the saga of panzer dragoon would be wildly different from those that came before it
7:10
both panzer dragoon and zvay were a looking glass view of a post-post apocalypse world
7:17
as the player glides through these far future landscapes on the back of their mighty winged beast unleashing vulcan
7:23
blasts and homing lasers they only ever get tantalizing glimpses from above at the world fallen into ruin below
7:31
thus was the stage set for ozil panzer dragoon rpg or as we know it outside of japan panzer dragoon's saga
7:38
it was time to get up close and personal with the world laid down in the first two games
7:43
panzer dragoon saga tells of an age where the earth as we know it is no more runaway climate change has caused
7:50
massive sea level rises and flooded all that remains of an ancient and highly advanced civilization
7:56
and yet in other parts of the planet most greenery and verdant life has given way to wastelands and creeping
8:03
desertification panzer dragoon invokes the same paradoxical future humanity is staring
8:09
down right this moment a world with too much water and yet also not nearly enough to go
8:15
around the web of influences here is as broad as it is deep
8:20
panzer dragoon contains the dna of so many major works of science fiction dune and star wars may come first to
8:27
mind but there are also noticeable parallels to works like 1973's animated psychedelic epic fantastic planet and
8:34
hayao miyazaki's 1985 anime opus nausica of the valley of the wind
8:39
in all of these fictional settings humanity are the bastard fallen children of their progenitors doomed to
8:45
hardscrabble suffering on devastated worlds as they scavenge among the ruins of a bygone golden age
8:52
there's one more point of comparison here and it's perhaps the most important one of all the team behind panzer dragoon cites as
9:00
one of their main inspirations the french comic artist and writer jean gerod better known by his nom de plume
9:07
moebius and indeed tributes to jerod's iconic bond destiny style can be seen across
9:14
the whole of the panzer dragoon series but there's more here than just
9:19
influence and inspiration in play team andromeda actually hired moebius to provide art and character designs for
9:26
the panzer dragoon series and the team was so impressed with his work that they turned his key visual
9:31
into the cover art for the japanese release of the first panzer dragoon dreaming in neon devotees take note
9:38
truly nothing can escape the long shadow of yodorowski's dune movies
9:43
have heart boom boom have mine
9:53
have ambition i wanted to do something like that why not
10:00
and this witch's brew of influences would eventually give rise to one of the most singular and iconic jrpgs ever
10:06
released a never-before-seen fusion of rpg and action shooter with a sweeping
10:12
orchestral score epic pre-rendered cutscenes compelling and fully voice acted characters a dynamic hybrid
10:19
turn-based combat system and full 3d exploration both on dragon and on foot
10:26
it seemed like an airtight plan the culmination of sega's attempts to assert itself as a major player in the home
10:32
console market one capable of offering high budget blockbuster experiences that rivaled anything from square or nintendo
10:39
but these things never work out quite the way they're supposed to
PART II: A Lost Legend Comes to Life
10:45
[Music] but i found something a lot more scary
10:52
than cocaine it's called nintendo
11:00
that's some kitty cocaine ah the 90s those halcyon days of the console wars
11:07
where the sega versus nintendo arguments spilled across conference tables lunch rooms and playgrounds and for a brief
11:14
moment in time it could truly be said that sega did what ninten didn't
11:25
[Music] in this brief post-genesis interregnum
11:33
of the early 90s sega actually had a fairly competitive share of the overall gaming space
11:38
from the release of the genesis down through to the launch of the saturn sega managed to claw back a sizeable slice of
11:44
the market from nintendo and with next generation showings like panzer dragoon in the offing it seemed
11:50
like the future of video games might just belong to sega but a short three years after the rushed
11:57
to market launch of the saturn war had changed from 1995 through 1998 sega's boom times
12:06
turned to bust the company's u.s office shrank from more than 2 000 employees to under 200
12:12
as the saturn slowly lost ground to a bold entrant on the scene the newly minted sony playstation
12:19
which further twisted the knife by undercutting the sega saturn's 399 launch price [Applause]
12:30
and so by the time of panzer dragoon saga's release in 1998 sega had largely
12:36
abandoned the saturn and shifted its focus to the impending launch of the dreamcast
12:41
sega's declining fortunes did not deter team andromeda if anything they were so possessed by
12:46
the ambition of their vision for panzer dragoon saga that they didn't realize just how challenging a task they had
12:52
taken for themselves until they were right in the thick of it as futatsuki told the ringer in 2018
12:59
a fully 3d rpg with beautiful visuals that kind of game hardly existed anywhere in the world which meant that
13:06
no matter what aspect of the game we were working on we had the challenge of making it entirely from whole cloth
13:13
but rather than treat this as an obstacle team andromeda took this as an opportunity to entirely reinvent
13:18
everything we thought we knew about the rpg genre there's no fat to trim from this
13:24
experience no slow start where your amnesiac protagonist hunts slimes and
13:29
completes fetch quests in the grassy hills around the starting town panzer dragoon saga gets right to the
13:35
good stuff awe-inspiring dragons in flight scenery chewing villains doing dastardly
13:41
deeds and colorful lasers going pew pew pew initially the game was planned to be
13:47
even more ambitious than the version we got rather than a straightforward a to b story driven experience panzer dragoon
13:54
saga was going to take place in a non-linear and open-ended world the player would be able to visit different
14:00
regions and complete quests in any order they wished an open world game years before open
14:06
world was a fixture in the game design lexicon i mean tell me with a straight face that
14:12
star fox meets daggerfall doesn't sound like it would just absolutely rip and tear
14:19
but with the saturn's hardware proving to be better suited for 2d sprites and artwork than for 3d rendering team
14:25
andromeda had to ditch their open world ambitions in favor of a more linear focused approach
14:31
while the resulting game may appear quite hefty releasing as it did on four jam-packed compact discs
14:37
most of those megabytes are reserved for the cinematics and high quality voice acting
14:58
oh yeah this game did the fully voice acted 3d rpg thing a full two years before final
15:05
fantasy 10. panzer dragoon saga did nearly everything that final fantasy 10 gets
15:11
praised for at a time when final fantasy 10 was just a twinkle in yoshinori katase's eye
15:17
but panzer dragoon saga is actually quite zvelt as far as epic jrpgs go anyway
15:22
a playthrough will only take you about 12 to 15 hours or maybe 20 if you're angling for a hundred percent
15:28
completionist run this is no chrono cross or xeno gears where revisiting a beloved classic means
15:34
you're looking at a minimum 40 to 50 hour commitment to see all of the main story beats that's not to say that panzer dragoon
15:41
saga is a simple or easy game it's the opposite really just as the game demonstrates a keen
15:47
sense of how to efficiently convey narrative and characterization it shows a similar focus when it comes to
15:53
modernizing jrpg standards for the 3d era all of the usual jrpg mechanics are here
16:00
your dragon will gain experience and level up as you defeat enemies just as you'll learn new abilities that
16:05
can augment your defensive skills heal and protect you or deliver a crushing final blow
16:10
you can also swap out parts for your dragon rider's gun either to boost your overall firepower or to better exploit
16:17
an enemy's weak points up until this point most japanese rpgs followed the canon first laid down by
16:23
those early dragon quests and final fantasies in these games all the action takes place on a single plane and is driven
16:30
entirely through menu interactions with your party trading blows and spells with the enemy until one side emerges
16:36
victorious but saga did something that at the time was totally unique and had never been
16:42
seen before as futatsuki put it the team's main ambition was to answer a singular
16:48
question what does exhilarating shooting combat look like in an rpg
16:54
panzer dragoon saga is indeed the answer to that question the game's combat system plays more like
17:00
a hybrid turn-based action shooter than an rpg the player's dragon can swoop
17:05
around your targets in all four cardinal directions in order to dodge enemy fire or zero in on weak points as indicated
17:12
by a dynamic compass on the hud depending on how you position yourself your attacks can do increased or
17:18
decreased damage and your character's defense likewise depends on the angle from which enemies attack you
17:24
you'll want to pay close attention to your positioning because how quickly you defeat enemies and how much damage you take affects your rank for each fight
17:32
which in turn determines how much experience and loot you receive outside of battle the player can mutate
17:38
their dragon by shifting around an ability slider to focus on four separate characteristics changing the dragon's
17:44
in-game appearance in the process you can boost attack for laser power agility to charge actions quicker
17:51
defense for well defense and spiritual for your magical berserk skills
17:57
but there are trade-offs to these boons boosting attack will make your character less powerful and spiritual and vice
18:03
versa while boosting defense will subtract from your character's agility this is no gimmick mechanic either
18:10
careful and thoughtful use of the dragon mutation system is a requirement for winning through some of the game's
18:15
toughest fights as each encounter proceeds the player's action gauge will fill up with each
18:21
charge allowing you to fire vulcans on a single enemy perform a multi-target laser attack use items or unleash your
18:28
dragon's special berserk abilities the game's equivalent of a magic system the combat encounters in panzer dragoon
18:34
saga are the furthest thing from your standard jrpg battle of attrition
18:39
cinematic camera angles combine with a bombastic and sweeping orchestral score adding verve to nearly every single
18:46
fight and bringing a sense of excitement and dynamism even when you're facing standard issue foes
18:52
actually we need to take a moment or three to gush about that soundtrack a little bit more this is a series that is
18:57
already known for its wild and inventive osts so much so that the soundtrack for the first two panzer dragoon games were
19:03
recorded in red book audio to this day if you have copies of the games handy you can pop them into the
19:09
nearest cd player and start jamming out but panzer dragoon saga raises the bar
19:15
that much further thanks to some truly masterful compositions by game music ace sauri kobayashi
19:21
glittering sci-fi synthesizers and ethereal vocals cavort with thunderous percussion and mournful stringed
19:28
instrumentals that wouldn't be out of place in a classical orchestral suite there's mystery and an electric sense of
19:34
momentum here the outset of a journey into a strange land twinned with the promise of untold mysteries waiting to
19:40
be uncovered by an enterprising explorer [Music]
19:56
it is far and away the single strongest constitutive element of the entirety of panzer dragoon saga the soundtrack is
20:02
eminently listenable on its own merits making for the perfect kind of rainy day jrpg music to smoke and study to vibe
20:12
[Music]
20:23
and it was such an important and influential work of game music that in 2018 brave wave records put out a
20:30
special 20th anniversary remaster of the panzer dragoon saga ost composed and
20:35
overseen by koboyashi herself but perhaps most interestingly of all the panzer dragoon saga soundtrack was
20:42
not recorded in a vacuum and then grafted onto the game as is so often the case after the designs of the different
20:48
levels and encounters were already finished team andromeda sent mock-ups over to kobayashi so that the game's
20:53
music could be composed in a way that lent the maximum amount of pathos to the visuals
20:59
panzer dragoon saga is nothing short of a brilliant cross-genre fusion that embodies the term avant-garde
21:06
as in far far ahead of its time rpg power progression and leveling
21:11
mechanics wedded to action shooter combat and adventure game exploration this is the mainstream standard today
21:18
but things were very different in 1998 with the exception of maybe front mission gun hazard there was simply no
21:26
other game that had done what panzer dragoon saga did when it arrived on the scene and its influence can be felt in
21:32
everything from fumito ueda's eco and shadow of the colossus all the way through to the mad lad himself yokotaro
21:41
[Music]
21:46
though taro has given some predictably evasive and trollish answers in public when asked about the series influence on
21:52
his work it's safe to say panzer dragoon was perhaps the chief inspiration behind the
21:58
development of the action shooter rpg drakengard aka dragon dragoon
22:05
which is the series that gave us near and then automata again we could easily spend a whole
22:10
video just recounting the outsized influence this game has had on the medium panzer dragoon saga is audacious
22:18
breathtaking and trailblazing and still remains one of the all-time great rpgs
22:23
on console so it's a genuine travesty that sega smothered this game in its crib and made
22:30
it almost impossible to play today [Music]
PART III: End Times
22:40
dragoon saga is in so many ways a tale of tragedy both the tragedy of its narrative and
22:46
the tragedy of the circumstances surrounding its release the game's story begins with our
22:52
protagonist edge seeing his co-workers and father figure gunned down by military madmen only to be saved by a
22:59
mysterious armored winged beast he then embarks on a journey to understand the nature and purpose of his
23:04
new dragon friend and that of the mysterious woman ozil who seems to share some connection with the ancient race of
23:11
progenitors whose ruins dot this blasted world throughout his quest for revenge edge is
23:18
beset by dead ends false starts calamity and death the nature of edge's mission is
23:24
open-ended and ambiguous left up to the player's interpretation is he a chosen child of destiny
23:30
possessed by a righteous cause to do battle with the forces of darkness and restore light to the world or was edge
23:36
merely in the wrong place at the wrong time trapping him in some kind of allegorical purgatory a half-living
23:43
corpse shambling through the ruins of a half-dead world both of these interpretations of panzer
23:49
dragoon saga story are by design equally correct the experience is what you the player
23:55
make of it and the game drives this point home by utterly shattering the fourth wall during the finale with the revelation
24:02
that the player is the divine spirit alluded to so many times throughout the game whose presence possesses edge and
24:09
gives shape and form to the world around him
24:16
[Music]
24:25
[Music]
24:45
or in this case all of panzer dragoon saga is nothing but a waking dream
24:50
shadows and light dancing at the half-remembered edges of your consciousness
24:55
and you the player are the dreaming dreamer with a flick of your finger you can
25:02
summon up strange and beautiful worlds or consign them to languish forgotten in
25:08
the darkness eternally [Music]
25:27
it's a sad and understated resolution to this saga one that mirrors the melancholic circumstances that
25:33
surrounded its creation and its release teams on both sides of the pacific ocean had to crunch mightily for this game
25:41
putting in ungodly work hours at a time when no one batted an eye at this kind of overwork especially in japanese
25:47
business culture two members of team andromeda passed away during the development of saga
25:53
one killed in a freak motorcycle accident and the other a senior mentor figure to futatsuki took their own life
25:59
[Music] and when it finally came time for the game to see the light of day the disappointments continued to mount
26:07
by early 1998 sega had already made the internal business decision that the saturn was a failure
26:12
and were shifting their focus and resources to their next generation console the dreamcast
26:18
in japan a muted marketing campaign and declining interest in the saturn generally meant that panzer dragoon saga
26:25
sold just over a hundred thousand copies a far cry from sega's initial expectations that this game would be
26:31
their multi-million selling trump card in the console wars surpassing even final fantasy
26:37
and outside of japan where the saturn had been essentially left for dead the situation was even more dire
26:43
panzer dragoon saga ended up being one of the final games released for the ailing and failing sega saturn
26:50
with sega ditching the saturn in favor of the dreamcast only a mere 20 000 copies of panther dragoon saga were
26:56
pressed for release in the u.s and a scant 1 000 more for europe and this
27:02
more than any other single factor is the reason why panzer dragoon saga is a game
27:07
nobody played as befits such a weak release the game was barely promoted or advertised at all
27:14
outside of japan and the marketing we did get could do little more than make self-conscious
27:19
jokes about how hard the game was to find like the infamous edge mask ad from
27:24
the september 98 issue of egm putting it more plainly with this paltry
27:30
kind of support from sega there was no way this could have ended other than in failure
27:36
in a different world in a different timeline one where panzer dragoon saga released on the playstation rather than
27:42
the saturn there's no doubt that this game would be spoken of in the same reverent and hushed tones reserved for
27:49
xenogears grandia and suicoden ii that's just a matter of simple arithmetic the playstation is one of the
27:57
best selling consoles in existence weighing in at more than 100 million systems worldwide and fully 80 million
28:04
of those sold outside of japan by contrast the saturn sold less than 10
28:09
million consoles worldwide and only 5 million of those outside of japan
28:14
but then panzer dragoon saga on a different console wouldn't be panzer dragoon saga
28:21
as futatsuki himself once put it on playstation the colors are brighter and on saturn the colors are cloudier
28:28
to express the atmosphere of panzer it was necessary to have the color palette of the saturn
28:34
it can be comforting to pine for a better and more just existence for the alternative timeline where our
28:42
talents and brilliance are duly recognized and we can bask in the glory we deserve
28:47
but this is not reality our hardships struggles and our failures
28:54
make us who we are just as much as our triumphs and all too often we cannot see and
29:01
appreciate our impact until many many years after the fact
29:06
that's true for me it's true for you watching this video right now and it's especially true of panzer
29:13
dragoon saga all of which is why today panzer dragoon saga is perhaps the rarest and most
29:20
expensive game ever released in the us and europe it is prohibitively expensive to play
29:25
this game legally and even the word prohibitively doesn't do justice to the situation at all
29:32
assuming you're able to even find a us or european copy of the game you'll be looking at spending a minimum of over
29:38
one thousand dollars just for the discs alone a pre-owned set that includes the case
29:43
will cost at least fifteen hundred or north of three thousand for sealed copies if those even truly exist anymore
29:53
which gets back to what we were talking about at the beginning of this video more so than just about any other game
29:59
languishing in copyright purgatory right now it is effectively impossible for the average retronaut to play panzer dragoon
30:06
saga on the original hardware besides the cost of the game itself the saturn also had a notoriously low
30:13
quality cd drive prone to wear and tear making it that much more difficult to
30:18
play the game nearly a quarter century after its release but even the dismal commercial failure
30:23
of panzer dragoon saga didn't spell the end of the series while team andromeda did disband after
30:29
releasing saga many members went on to work for developer smile bit on panzer dragoon orta the sequel that was
30:35
released on the xbox in 2002 and series creator fatatsuki would go on
30:41
to develop phantom dust a spiritual successor to panzer dragoon that was released for the xbox in 2004 and again
30:48
for the xbox one and windows in 2017 you actually can play this one right now
30:53
for free on xbox and windows pcs orta was a brilliant return to form of
30:59
the classic rail shooting gameplay of the first two panzer dragoons and phantom dust was an absolutely ahead
31:05
of its time fusion of the shooter rpg deck building and adventure game genres
31:12
recent years have seen even more encouraging news for panzer dragoon aficionados a decently competent remake of the first
31:18
game was released in 2020 by megapixel studios for the switch and pc with a remake of zvay supposedly to
31:24
follow sometime in 22. but sadly panzer dragoon's saga will not
31:30
be such an easy nut to crack for many years the deep lore slash rumors surrounding this game suggested
31:37
that its source code had been lost at some point either when team andromeda disbanded or
31:43
in the lead-up to sega's ill-fated exit from the console hardware business after the dreamcast
31:49
without the source code a remaster or re-release of the original panzer dragoon saga would be basically
31:55
impossible but recently during a gdc 2019 panel on
32:00
the panzer dragoon series futatsuki gave this intriguing answer when asked about the status of saga's source code so we
32:08
mastered up saga and then between our master date and our release date i left
32:14
the company so the real truth the true story is that i don't know what happened to the source
32:21
code however
32:31
however i have heard rumors and maybe everyone here has heard rumors
32:36
that it may have been discovered uh somewhere at some point
32:42
but forget that i even said that once you leave this room [Laughter]
32:49
that said the outlook for saga still isn't all that rosy at best having the source code will make
32:55
it a bit easier to create an upscaled emulated version of the original game if they decide to go that route
33:01
but a full-on bluepoint style hd remake of the game will take hundreds of staffers and millions and millions of
33:08
dollars to execute regardless of whether or not they have the source code and assets for a game written in 25 year old
33:15
assembly language for a dead and buried console and given how niche panzer dragoon saga
33:20
was even at the time of its release and the relative lack of interest in preserving all but the most famous and
33:26
notable games of this era at this point i wouldn't expect much from sega or any other developer or
33:32
publisher the most exciting news on this front actually comes from the fandom
33:37
a dedicated group of panzer dragoon fanatics recently launched the azel resurrection project an attempt to
33:43
create a proof of concept for a saga remake in the hopes that sego will license the game out for third-party
33:49
development as was the case with the release of streets of rage 4. but no matter whether we pin our hopes
33:56
on sega or on the fandom it seems like we're a long long way off from panzer
34:01
dragoon saga seeing the light of day again and so that's where this story ends
34:07
through a combination of bad luck bad timing and the oppressive strictures of international copyright law one of the
34:14
all-time greatest rpgs will languish forever in the sega vaults alone and
34:19
forgotten in some dark and dusty corner
34:24
well that noise because it's not over yet [Music]
PART IV: How to Train Your Drago[o]n
34:46
so the reports of panzer dragoon saga's death have been greatly exaggerated
34:52
this game is not dead and buried and it never has been emulation software for the sega saturn
34:59
has existed in some form or another since the early 2000s but for quite a few years it did seem
35:05
like it might be nearly impossible to create a lightweight and widely compatible emulator comparable to what
35:11
was available for the snes and playstation and this was due in large part to the
35:17
saturn's dual cpu hardware which made emulation an even trickier proposition
35:22
than coding for the system in the first place i mean one of the most high profile saturn
35:27
emulators is named yabausei which is literally an acronym for yet another
35:33
broken and unstable saturn emulator but 2004 saw the first release of the
35:38
ssf emulator which set the standard for compatibility and speed on windows pcs
35:44
and in the years since then emulators like mednofen chronos and yabba sanchiro
35:49
have raised the bar even further with implementations that can work standalone on windows mac linux and android and ios
35:57
as well as plug-in cores for retroarch the notion that sega saturn emulation
36:03
sucks is just that an urban legend there was a grain of truth to it in the
36:08
early days but since then it's nothing but a myth that has spun wildly out of control
36:14
from at least the early to mid 2010s onward anybody with a mid-range gpu or
36:19
laptop could play the majority of the saturn library on their pc including panzer drago","This is the story of the most important and influential RPG ever released -- which happens to be a game that next to nobody played, especially when it first came out.

This game is also THE case study in why emulation is the key to retro games preservation. Join me on this journey, and bring the legend back to life.

[Music]
0:50
the hollywood savior was an expected and natural progression of the atypical hollywood hero john mclean is a far cry
0:57
from john keating on the surface but when the common consensus on storytelling is that every story needs a
1:02
hero it's only natural that a story about teachers and the education system would find one character to pen heroic
1:09
ambition and sainthood on and it works because generally people love movies
1:14
that make them feel good movies that make them want to follow their dreams or be a positive influence i fully intend
1:20
on poking holes in and poking fun at some of the more questionable takes in the teacher savior subgenre so beloved
1:27
by many but i'd like to make it known that i typically enjoy the hell out of a feel-good teacher movie school of rock
1:34
link later's best film i don't care what anyone says like little pepino still makes me cry
1:43
and i'm even worse with the feel good sports movie for a person who does not watch and knows very little about sports
1:49
put a paint by numbers inspirational sports movie in front of me and you've given me a comfort movie for life i've
1:54
seen coach carter enough times to have not only the dialogue memorized but every single needle drop to a t and i
2:01
still get emotional when teemo wants to rejoin the basketball team but he owes coach all these push-ups and suicides
2:07
and he doesn't do enough in time to be part of the team again and like i'll do push-ups for him i'll do something
2:13
i'll run suicides too i do some too one person struggles with struggle one player
2:19
right i love it so i won't act as if i don't get the appeal of these movies or like i
2:24
don't have the faintest idea as to why hollywood loves this trope so truly madly deeply what i do intend to
2:30
question is the framing devices used in these movies the educators it chooses to highlight its racial implications the
2:36
failure of nuance when these stories many of which are based on reality are put through the black and white filter
2:41
of play it safe hollywood and the real life impact these films have on the already failing american education
2:47
system this is my classroom you don't like it the doors to my left
2:52
lady why you be tripping like that no jamal
2:58
you be trippin so where exactly did the save our students trope begin if we look back far
3:03
enough it seems like a tale as old as time even prior to blackboard jungle the film often credited with kickstarting
3:09
the subgenre that's pronounced
3:16
there was bright road bright road was a 1953 film based on school teacher mary
3:21
elizabeth roman's short story a piece of fiction loosely based on her experiences with teaching and published in a june
3:28
1951 edition of ladies home journal the film adaptation starred legendary players dorothy dandridge and harry
3:34
belafonte and their first of many on-screen collaborations thank you mr williams
3:39
that's all right miss richards good afternoon good afternoon mr williams
3:45
what are we talking about chemistry we're talking about chemistry man jane richards is a young novice school
3:51
teacher nervous about her first year of teaching she has some difficulty with troubled student ct but slowly gets
3:57
through to him by being empathetic and patient the movie is also about her burgeoning romance with the principal mr
4:02
williams bright road along with being one of the first in this subgenre is also only one of the very few or maybe
4:09
like two films that exist about black women being teachers and being a positive influence on their students but
4:17
you know what to do with your pen by now it wasn't until blackboard jungle in 1955 and later up the down staircase
4:23
that the scenario began to shift with the real world beginning to have more desegregation we got stories about white
4:30
school teachers having to teach black and brown kids and not knowing how to control them which in itself is already
4:35
a bit it's here in history that you can see the wheels of the hollywood mind
4:41
beginning to turn the appeal it seems in making these movies isn't just to churn out inspirational water it's to utilize
4:49
the fish out of water trope by putting a narrow and specific focus on white teachers being thrown into this mostly
4:55
black world the hook for audiences being what is such a straight-laced person doing in such a wild environment
5:02
literally the original trailer for up the down staircase asks this of its white protagonist entering a
5:08
multi-racial school zone hey just a minute what is a nice girl like you doing in a
5:14
crazy place like this and that question partly answers why we see so many of these stories and why
5:20
it's usually a white teacher being thrust into a mostly black and brown school these schools are on screen
5:26
treated like they're the dark underworlds of chaos and fear hollywood loves the savior trope because it's
5:32
partly a fish out of water trope and they love using the fish out of water trope alongside race in class because
5:38
the dichotomy is fascinating and makes for good storytelling but rarely do these films observe that dichotomy in a
5:43
way that captures all the gray areas and all the nuances of what it means to be positioned above a group of people and
5:49
not only authority but in class and society in these movies a white teacher enters an unruly school full of students
5:56
who are not only badly behaved but who can barely read or write or have a poor understanding of basic arithmetic rarely
6:03
do these stories consider the situations that have put these students into such a state the correlation between illiteracy
6:09
and poverty or the low state funding that can result in schools having outdated textbooks understaffed
6:14
buildings and underpaid teachers they have no problem depicting these students not wanting to go to school or even
6:20
skipping school altogether but rarely do they go into the why because often times and especially in communities with low
6:27
school funding students don't want to go to school because they can see from the dilapidated buildings and the old
6:32
textbooks and the uninspired teachers that no one really cares if they get an education or not so why bother these
6:39
movies scarcely look at all the ways in which the education system as a whole is pretty flawed and it rarely acknowledges
6:46
the work of any teacher outside of the main character two great and infamous examples are dangerous minds and freedom
6:53
writers in dangerous minds the fictional counterpart of luanne johnson is framed as being the only teacher who cares
7:00
about her students and wants them to succeed the school is marred and graffiti and litter the students are so
7:06
badly behaved that luanne has to resort to karate lessons to get them to be quiet for five [ __ ] seconds and the
7:12
entire faculty has essentially given up on these kids but the movie adaptation is so vastly different from reality that
7:19
even knowing hollywood is behind it it gets a little laughable teachers who worked at karl mont high the school
7:25
depicted in the movie have made it a point over the years to clarify that the school they taught at was not the school
7:30
depicted in the final cut it should also be noted that dangerous minds was based on the cringely titled memoir my posse
7:38
don't do homework but i don't blame johnson for the film adaptation because as she learned after seeing the movie
7:43
post-release in 1995 hollywood lies are akin to wildfires once they get started
7:49
it ravishes everything in sight until you can't recognize what was there before and even she took issue with some
7:56
of the liberties taken by the filmmakers for instance the producers were really pushing to include a subplot where
8:02
johnson was suspended from the school for having a relationship with her student bewildered johnson of course
8:08
told them that they couldn't do that they insisted that it would add a bit of sexiness to the story even more
8:13
bewildered johnson was like bro i'm a teacher you can't say i did something like that because people will think that
8:18
i did it i could lose my job that is illegal and they were like oh fine party pooper just want a [ __ ] student how
8:24
disappointing but the liberties didn't stop there wade dominguez's character is murdered toward the end of the movie
8:30
despite the fact that no student of johnson's during her time at carlemont high school was killed and she never
8:36
faced so much animosity from her students and their families for being white in the movie the grandmother of
8:41
two of her students pulls her grandson out of school and when johnson goes to see what's going on the grandmother says
8:47
this hi i'm luanne johnson i'm the boys teacher i know who you are
8:52
you're that white red [ __ ] messing with my baby's mind to that johnson was quick
8:57
to dispute it was really insulting most of these black grandmothers are church-going women and it taps into a
9:04
misconception that black parents are going to be antagonistic toward white people which wasn't my experience many
9:10
of these teacher savior movies aren't about critiquing the education system in fact i'd say most of them aren't
9:16
remotely concerned about critiquing the education system but what they all have in common is an overvaluing of trauma
9:23
porn and poverty porn teachers employed at carlemont high school were clear to say that the school wasn't nearly as bad
9:29
as it was shown to be in dangerous minds no student of johnson's was murdered just off campus despite her best efforts
9:35
to protect him in fact the real life person dominus's character was based on went on to join the marine corps and in
9:41
the case of freedom writers the 2007 film based on the 1999 book it's really not that much different critics of the
9:48
film adaptation have pointed out how different the long beach school looked on screen than how it actually looked in
9:53
1993 to 1998 the time period in which the story takes place they've also pointed out that aaron cruel the teacher
10:00
at the center of the story also taught middle-class white students and that many teachers at the school assisted her
10:05
in achieving her goals with her class judging from the film you'd think that no teacher had ever tried this worse
10:11
you'd guess that apart from the noble gruel no other teacher cares gruelle's work is noteworthy but it is by no means
10:18
unusual racism is another thing these movies want to focus on but in the same way that these movies do all the time
10:24
which is to put racism off as being something that only the worst of individuals do and that has nothing to
10:29
do with a system of disadvantage and freedom writers gruel is confronted by a fellow teacher who is almost
10:35
cartoonishly racist this character is the worst of the worst but that's as far as the film goes in its portrayal of
10:41
implicit bias and discrimination in the school environment these films usually have a fixation on highlighting race
10:47
specifically the animosity black students feel for their nice white lady teachers and the odd cartoonish racist
10:53
but they all lack the self-awareness it seems to realize they're leaning a little heavily into a white savior
10:59
narrative during the filming of dangerous minds actress brooklyn harris asked luanne johnson why it was that
11:05
stories like these always centered on white people uplifting the quote poor little negroes and johnson simply said i
11:13
wrote the book i have to be white but harris's question was valid i don't think she was asking luanne johnson why
11:18
she wrote a story about a white teacher uplifting black students i'm pretty sure she knew it was a memoir having seen a
11:24
lot of these movies come and go i can't help but notice that there's always a consistency in what movies are selected
11:30
to be adapted into films and that there are a disproportionate amount of adaptations based on the writings of
11:36
white teachers and inner city schools there are teachers of color who not only teach in these communities but live in
11:42
these communities who make a difference for their students every day but those aren't the stories that get told you
11:47
would think based on the makeup of these movies that there were very few black educators who made a difference in their
11:52
classrooms and that there weren't any who wrote books about those experiences but one of the teachers who live in
11:58
those neighborhoods and teach at those schools what of the stories of the teachers who have always been there
12:05
in case you haven't noticed mrs collins we are in a ghetto these children don't want to learn
12:10
the ghetto is not the enemy miss denny i suppose you mean we are indifferences
12:23
i feel sometimes like a person to whom and childhood was entrusted some sacred flame this is the desire to see my race
12:30
lifted out of the mire of ignorance weakness and degradation no longer to sit in obscure corners and devour the
12:37
scraps of knowledge which his superiors flung at him i want to see him crowned with strength and dignity adorned with
12:44
the enduring grace of intellectual attainments on may 17 1954 after years
12:50
of the civil rights movement and efforts of black school teachers across the country the supreme court ruled for
12:55
desegregating all schools citing segregation as unconstitutional black kids were bused to schools that were now
13:01
integrated facing a lot of animosity and violence from white parents and students who did not want them there the little
13:08
rock 9 was not that long ago the kids show up to school on september 4th 1957
13:14
the first day of school the senior in the group of the little rock nine is ernest green and he is like oh my gosh
13:22
there is an ass load of angry white people black schools and institutions were slowly but surely shuttered and
13:28
countless black teachers and principals were either demoted to driving buses becoming lunch ladies and school
13:34
janitors or they were fired and had to find after years of being an educator another form of work today people lament
13:42
the scarcity of black teachers in the education system but few acknowledge the ways in which black educators were shut
13:48
out of education almost as soon as segregation ended black students already had a difficult time being accepted into
13:55
white schools black teachers going into white schools and teaching white kids also didn't sit well with white teachers
14:01
or white parents even after the negative effects of integration with black students being placed in often hostile
14:07
environments and black teachers being fired black teachers still try to advocate for the changes they initially
14:13
envisioned when pushing for integration but under the positive white noise of brown versus board of education no one
14:20
would hear them out the way dangerous minds and freedom writers and the plethora of other films focused on the
14:26
white savior teacher narrative are so fixated on race you'd think more opportunities would be taken to
14:31
highlight the stories of the few black teachers that were integrated into white schools or the resistance black students
14:37
faced from white teachers just after integration but when these stories from black teachers were told they were also
14:43
swiftly dismissed and here is where we have got to talk about beryl gilroy
14:50
[Music]
15:06
beryl gilroy the first blackhead teacher in britain after teaching in guyana from the late 40s up until the 50s she moved
15:14
to london and looked for work as a teacher there at the time though there was so much hostility towards black
15:20
folks that she struggled to get a job and when she did eventually get one in the late 60s she faced a riot of racist
15:27
abuse from not only fellow teachers and parents but from her very own students
15:33
when i came out so you eyed me with a look of puree and curiosity not being rude she said just being
15:40
inquisitive what do natives do when they go to bed i asked
15:45
you know she said self-consciously gesturing your monthlies
15:52
you mean when we menstruate i asked she nodded well sue i replied with mock seriousness
15:59
we swim we jump into the nearest river and swim and swim for miles some of us swim for
16:04
three days and some for four but that's what we do in 1976 gilroy published a
16:10
book aptly titled black teacher which detailed her experience being a fish out of water teaching in a mostly white
16:16
school where the students often discounted her because of her race and you know how the public responded do you
16:22
want to guess do you think they made a film adaptation of her work do you think that like up the down staircase it
16:28
became a best seller well spoiler alert honey a lot of people were really mad many critics put the book down as being
16:35
unrealistic they insisted that gilroy's experience of racism in london schools
16:40
wasn't actually racism at all that she was even making some of it up some went as far as to say it wasn't that hard for
16:47
her to get a job as a teacher and that whatever racism she thought she experienced couldn't have been that bad
16:52
because she got to be a teacher anyway and beryl gilroy's telling of experiencing racism of being put in this
16:58
new world where so much hatred was hurled at her critics questioned whether they needed to hear about it again i get
17:04
it i get it they seem to say racism was bad and immigrants are treated awfully but we're fine now so do i really need
17:11
to hear about it again get over it whereas with teachers like luanne johnson the filmmakers adapting her
17:16
story were obsessed with centralizing her experience being deplored by students and parents for her race even
17:22
though those were not her experiences in one scene johnson is branded a white bred [ __ ] by an enraged grandparent of
17:29
african-american twins who have dropped out of class jonathan tells me that this never happened i asked them where did
17:36
that come from they said we were sure that some of the black and the hispanic parents must have resented you i said
17:42
for what for helping their kids hell nobody ever ever said anything to me
17:47
like that if these stories are really about highlighting the work of teachers or highlighting racism stories like
17:53
gilroy's wouldn't be so easily dismissed while stories like up the down staircase by belle kaufman would become acclaimed
18:00
bestsellers and spawn film adaptations and it's not quite just a case of wanting white stories over black stories
18:06
because we get quite a few stories about black male teachers and coaches saving their students many of which are also
18:12
based on true stories the george mckenna story remember the titans which is very interesting about race the great debate
18:19
get out of here denzel god coach carter pride and the father of all to sir with
18:24
love it's also important to make the distinction that although to sir with love was the story of a black teacher
18:29
teaching in a multiracial but mostly white british school and not being able to control the children he didn't really
18:35
centralize his experiences with racial discrimination in such a way that white readers became uncomfortable which
18:41
probably explains why beryl gilroy writing not just about teaching and becoming headmaster but about the
18:46
resistance she faced to get to that point was met with backlash at the time people were much more comfortable not
18:51
being reminded about the existence of the racism she had to live through every day cinema has always been more
18:57
comfortable with having black male leads than with having black female leads so movies about white male educators or
19:03
white female educators or black male educators have often taken precedence over movies about black female educators
19:09
which are so rare that despite so many black women in education there are only two movies based on their stories in
19:16
1981 the marva collins movie was produced for tv starring the great sicily tyson this made for tv movie is a
19:23
great deal better than i think a lot of people would expect but of course it is cicely tyson so
19:30
i mean marvin collins was a chicago-based educator who started her own private school called west side prep
19:36
elementary after feeling disappointed by the education system and noting how it seemed to be failing a lot of students
19:42
she was disillusioned by the faculty of the public school she had been teaching at and took five thousand dollars to buy
19:47
a space in west garfield park her own neighborhood to give students the education she thought they deserved she
19:53
taught the children the expected essentials but also went as far as to teach the socratic method shakespeare
19:59
and other classic literature before making this decision she worked as a substitute teacher throughout inner
20:04
cities in chicago which she did for over 14 years here was a teacher who saw how schools were failing students
20:10
particularly low-income students and not only adjusted her method of teaching but decided to open a private school on her
20:16
own dime westside prep elementary took tuition but for the students who couldn't afford it school was often free
20:22
it was important to collins that the black children being abandoned by the education system would find their footing and not be dismissed or
20:28
mislabeled before they had a chance to learn i will be superior in my ability
20:35
[Applause] in my thoughts in my deeds
20:40
and in my actions and you must be so
20:46
who is the most important child in this world i am and what is the most important time
20:51
no now and i don't want you to waste either one of them the movie brought marva collins a lot
20:58
more recognition and with admirers came hordes of detractors her most famous anti-fan was george and schmidt who
21:04
insisted time and time again that collins was lying and that her students couldn't possibly be capable of what she
21:10
said they were capable of that these students were unteachable and any progress collins claimed to have made with them was entirely fabricated but
21:17
these stories the bright roads and the marvin collins's movies aren't the norm the two movies were released nearly 30
21:24
years apart from each other and now it's been over 40 years since the marva collins movie and stories about black
21:29
women in education are still pretty rare the stories that are so often selected to be highlighted are about the
21:35
experiences of white teachers with the suggestion being that good teaching is only exceptional when it's white
21:40
teachers undertaking the task and even then only when their teaching is directed towards students of color
21:46
because they're so damn unteachable these damn kids damn so when we go back and look at the
21:53
question of race in these movies and how it's presented it becomes clear that the movies in their aim to dismantle racism
21:59
isn't that at all it's instead a depiction of nice white people with the intent of upholding the idea of a
22:06
post-racial society many of these movies are often more concerned with showing the experiences of white teachers having
22:12
them experience a bit of pushback for being white and giving them a taste of racism by having them talk to a racist
22:18
individual who is one bad apple when they take shape these films suggest a
22:23
civic duty for white people it is their duty to help the ignorant black folks in
22:28
their lives it is their duty to save them from themselves it is
22:35
their burden i have some wonderful news for you
22:43
what nina you're fired
22:48
fly fly like a bird oh you have finally lost harsh medicine i know but it's what
22:54
you need this job is what i need this job pays for my health insurance and i get to take free classes nina sweetheart
22:59
trust me i know what's best for you you don't know what's best for me you don't even know me you think i'm some little
23:05
helpless black girl who can't make it in the world without the help of some enlightened white guy showing her the
23:10
way and you say i don't know you [Music]
23:22
in 1898 the spanish-american war came to an end when the u.s and spain signed the
23:27
treaty of paris the treaty put an end to the war with spain's seeding sovereignty of cuba puerto rico guam and the
23:33
philippines to the united states since magellan discovered the philippines claim of the country was staked by the
23:40
spanish empire the occupation lasting for over 300 years during the spanish-american war an agreement
23:46
basically a purchase made between spain and the us led to the spanish occupation slowly ending while the american
23:53
occupation was just beginning but it wasn't going to be that simple after a few centuries of occupation the filipino
23:59
people wanted independence and a month after the treaty of paris revolutionary emilio aguinaldo established the first
24:06
philippine republic in mao los bulacan this conflict incited the philippine-american war an event of mass
24:12
brutality and atrocities you had one side fighting for the freedom they'd been barred from for over 300 years and
24:19
the other side fighting against that freedom for freedom and insisting that they were indeed only fighting for the
24:25
freedom of the other side this justification the idea that the u.s government and its army were only doing
24:31
what was best for the savage filipinos is what gave us benevolent assimilation the policy that insisted that the goal
24:38
of the war was not to decimate the filipinos but to save them from something that they didn't really need
24:44
saving from emilio aguinaldo during the spanish-american war actually led the filipino army to recapturing many parts
24:50
of the philippines so i kind of think like they were fine the goal of this assimilation was to save filipino people
24:58
from their uncivil ways and this was done through the atrocities of war and also through education during the u.s
25:04
occupation the thomasites had the duty of teaching the filipino youth civility the duty of instructing them to embrace
25:11
instead the american way the guerrilla war that ensued and the understandable resistance of the philippines was what
25:18
inspired the one and only rudyard kipling to make what is without a doubt his most famous piece of writing
25:26
white man's burden [Music]
25:37
take up the white man's burden send forth the best ye breed
25:42
go bind your sons to exile to serve your captive's knee to wait in heavy harness unflutted folk
25:50
and wire your new quartz sullen people's half devil and half child
25:56
take up the white man's burden impatience to abide to veil the threat
26:01
of terror and check the show of pride by open speech and simple 100 times made
26:08
plain to seek another's profit and work another's game
26:13
take up the white man's burden the savage wars of peace fill full the mouth of famine and bid
26:21
the sickness cease and when your goal is nearest the end for other sword
26:27
watch sloth and heal and folly bring all your hopes to naught
26:32
take up the white man's birth no tawdry rule of kings the toil of surf
26:38
and sweeper the tale of common theme the ports ye shall not enter the roads
26:43
ye shall not tread go make them with your living and mark them with your dead
26:50
take up the white man's birth and reap his own reward the blame of those ye
26:55
better the hate of those he guard the cry of hosting humor slowly toward
27:02
the light why brought ye us from bondage our loved egyptian knight
27:08
take up the white man's burden ye dare not stoop to less nor call too loud on
27:14
freedom to cloak your weariness but all ye cry or whisper by all ye leave or do
27:21
the silent sullen people shall wear your gods and you take up the white man's birth have done
27:28
with childish days the lightly prophet laurel the easy ungrudged praise
27:34
comes now to search your man through all the thankless years cold
27:39
edged with dear brought wisdom the judgment of your peers
27:46
this poem is like the anthem of the white savior it implores its readers to
27:51
dismiss and discredit whatever the people they're trying to save have to say strip them of their agency of their
27:57
identity continue to drag them to your definition of civilization no matter how much they kick and scream and beg you
28:03
not to no matter how much damage you're actually doing you can hide behind the excuse that you are nobly carrying these
28:09
people away from barbarism and into refinement this philosophy was also the key factor in the development of the
28:16
civilization fund act an act pushing for the re-education of native americans with the aim to civilize them
28:22
benevolently as a result a bunch of boarding schools catered to native american children were opened throughout
28:28
the united states and canada they operated from the late 1800s all the way up until the 1960s and they were awful
28:35
children were taken to these schools against their will against the will of their families stripped of their
28:40
identities punished if they spoke their language abused and many were killed historians are still in the process of
28:46
uncovering numerous mass graves from these institutions and are still investigating the extent of the
28:51
depravities and the inhumanity that these children were subjected to i will not pretend to be an expert on this i'm
28:58
still learning and still reading as more information comes along but what i will
29:03
do is direct you to articles and books that have helped me out and
29:09
just generally toward people who can tell you more or who know more about the topic than i do i bring up this history
29:16
the burden as it pertains to this white supremacist thinking to give a better idea as to why and how these subgenres
29:23
can be so inherently questionable or inherently
29:30
problematic they are more than just those spiritual teacher movies about uplifting students and doing the right
29:36
thing they are about more than supporting a confounded youth desperately searching for meaning because the framing of these stories
29:42
echoes these sentiments from the 1800s the idea that these kids are lost and that the only way they can be found is
29:49
through the nobility of a brave or nice white person and it's tricky because dangerous minds and freedom writers and
29:56
that one with matthew perry and that lifetime one and that other lifetime one are all based on true stories
30:02
so what do i want what is the point do i want white teachers to just not be helpful to their black students do i
30:08
want white teachers to not teach at predominantly black schools no what i do want is for teachers white or not to
30:15
avoid going into these schools with this insidious savior mindset in for white
30:20
folks who teach in the hood and the rest of y'all too reality pedagogy and urban education christopher emdin wrote about
30:27
his first day teaching at an inner city school and how he and a fellow teacher were both projecting on to new freshmen
30:33
this idea they had of them an idea that came from media from the news decrying
30:38
how awful these schools and these students were and possibly for other teachers from movies they watched so
30:44
they could learn how to teach they were already looking at these kids as if they were troublemakers when in reality they
30:49
were just nervous 14 year old kids wearing their nicest clothes on the first day of school though our
30:55
motivations and experiences were different in the course of our conversations we learned we had one
31:01
thing in common to see urban youth of color as a group that is potentially dangerous and needs to be saved from
31:08
themselves for all teachers regardless of race going into teaching with a savior mindset leaves students at a
31:14
disadvantage implicit bias seeps into the minds of the educators which then affects how their people see themselves
31:20
and even how or if they're going to learn when teachers approach teaching with themselves in focus with the idea
31:26
that they and only they are going to fix or save a student they place themselves

Instagram Hates Its Users,"1,001,437","57,000",8/31/22,31:33,"0:00
everyone is mad at instagram right now and for good reason the app
0:05
used to be about photos and now it's trying to do tick-tock like
0:10
every app is youtube is becoming tick-tock tick-tock has been becoming tick-tock for years now also facebook i
0:18
think is becoming tick-tock i i can't even tell you what app i'm using anymore because i just find myself scrolling a
0:25
little vertical video feed of random things that probably did originate on
0:30
tick tock but now they're being recycled and repackaged on every other tick tock
0:36
copycat and instagram is making a big push that is
0:41
destroying the fabric of our universe so anyway the kardashians posted this a couple of weeks ago and the kardashians
0:48
are very powerful influencers the term influencer is kind of overused these days but the kardashians are like true
0:55
influencers like when kylie jenner was mad at snapchat and she or not mad she just said that she doesn't use it
1:01
anymore snapchat lost billions of dollars of market value so the kardashians are aware of their impact
1:08
and they use it oh boy do they use their influence just like kylie's using that private jet seems like nobody myself
1:15
included is liking the direction that instagram is going by the way follow me
1:21
at jarvis always be plugging so today we're gonna look at what's going on with instagram why the kardashians kind of
1:27
have a point and also why instagram probably doesn't care what we think but first i want to go into a little bit of
1:32
history about instagram and how we got here in the first place instagram had its humble beginnings as a mobile
1:39
check-in app in 2010 do you remember foursquare it was like that apparently they didn't want to compete with
1:45
foursquare so they changed the app to focus more on photo sharing but now they have a photo sharing app with no way to
1:50
stand out so on a trip to the beach as legend has it founder of instagram kevin
1:56
systrom was discussing with his wife the app and why she didn't want to take
2:01
photos on the app and she was like well if i post photos they're never gonna be as good as our friend greg's we we all
2:08
know a greg to which kevin replied greg isn't that good of a photographer he just uses filter apps on his photos and
2:17
ding dong what's that that's the sound of a billion dollar company being born so
2:23
they added filters to instagram and the rest is history suck it greg two short years later an awesome hunk of a man
2:29
named mark zuckerberg in his little company facebook bought instagram for 1
2:35
billion good morning jarvis oh hi mark after the original instagram founders left
2:41
instagram started to become more and more like facebook i think we all kind of felt this and it makes sense when you
2:47
think about it because instagram is essentially the only reason other than memes that facebook is still something
2:54
that people talk about and in that way facebook is kind of like the drake of social media where they keep stealing
3:00
from smaller artists to stay relevant in 2013 when facebook acquired instagram they only paid 1 billion
3:08
to acquire the product and team that is a steal by today's standards and today
3:15
it is standard for instagram to steal the best features of every other app sorry i feel like i need to
3:21
contextualize that billion dollar number i think faze clan just went public faze
3:27
clan is worth more than instagram was when facebook bought it let that sink in also
3:33
elon musk offered to buy twitter for like 50 2013 instagrams facebook also
3:39
tried to buy snapchat for three billion dollars like around the same time while currently instagram is getting a lot of
3:46
heat for reals and essentially trying to become tick-tock and steal their whole flow let's talk about some of the other
3:52
things that instagram has stolen over the years no one probably remembers this i i forgot facebook had 15 second
4:00
looping video to compete with vine like the 15 second video thing some of these features are no longer in instagram
4:07
uh because they were more about attacking another businesses model or trying to get into another space to
4:13
compete with snapchat facebook created like disappearing messages that you could send to people a famous one is
4:19
snapchat stories i think that people forget that facebook just up and stole
4:24
the whole feature of snapchat stories and it hurts snapchat a lot so be real
4:30
you know a lot of people are talking about be real right now instagram is uh copying its dual camera feature
4:38
and that's like a test that's running right now that i don't even know if they'll keep but they're definitely like seeing if it sticks but then they were
4:44
like okay tick tock time let's let's copy tick tock and this isn't even the first time they copied tick tock
4:50
facebook made a whole app called lasso that was just a tick tock clone like
4:55
straight up and nobody used it so they're like we've got to put this into instagram so at least people
5:02
will be forced to use it in fact instagram reels have replaced all video
5:07
you cannot upload a video on instagram it has to be a real or it becomes a real
5:13
on their on their back end so you can tell that they are really sort of positioning this
5:19
first and foremost in their app there's a whole reels tab you can scroll on it
5:24
and you can look at recycled tick tocks it reminds me of youtube shorts where you can also do that
5:31
so facebook is ruining instagram one feature at a time and that brings us to a couple of weeks ago where like i was
5:36
saying earlier kylie jenner kim kardashian reposted on their stories this post from an artist named uh named
5:44
tati bruning or brunning um that said make instagram instagram again i'm
5:50
starting a movement let's bring back the old instagram share this to your stories and sign my petition link on my story
5:56
this is kind of funny to me because while the complaints are valid the
6:01
actual change.org petition also the fact that there's a change.org petition is a little silly to me because i don't know
6:07
what they what they expect but let's look at the change.org petition so the post got about 2 million likes which is a lot and
6:14
300 000 people have signed the petition so unfortunately uh it has failed
6:21
instagram will not be going back to the old instagram because that's how things work right this is ridiculous okay this
6:27
is ridiculous again the complaints are valid but this is
6:33
you know corny and i'm gonna have to unfortunately call it out we the people declare that this is what we want we the
6:40
people those are powerful words they've been used before on a social network we like to call the united
6:46
states of america bring back chronological timelines there's no need to over complicate things we just want
6:53
to see when our friends post the beauty of instagram was that it was instantaneous back in the dawn of the
6:59
app we were all living in the moment seeing our best moments in real time that is all the way false
7:05
the big criticism is i want to see what my friends post and i want to see it in order twitters have that criticism
7:11
facebook had that criticism back in the day when they went to an algorithmic feed instagram is having that now this is a classic criticism but to
7:18
imply that at the beginning of instagram we were all living in the moment seeing our best moments in real time is just a
7:25
lie we were always putting forward our best versions of ourselves or posting shitty
7:32
filtered food pics instagram has always been a vain vanity app that everyone is
7:37
kind of made fun of and it is not lost on me that the people complaining the loudest the people with the biggest
7:42
platforms are the people who have huge financial incentives and potential financial gain the kardashians instagram
7:50
is the platform where they famously you know slipped the fcc guidelines and did a ton of
7:55
sponsorships without disclosing them which reminds me today's video is sponsored by factor oh no i've been
8:01
scrolling instagram so long that now i have no time to make food well it's a good thing that i order meals from
8:07
factor factory delivers fresh never frozen and dietitian approved meals right to your
8:13
doorstep they have a team of gourmet chefs that create each meal using only ingredients of integrity to help you
8:19
feel your best all day long i've used factor for over a year now i was already
8:24
receiving my regular factor meal and then they sent me another box of factor meals so i had double the food factor's
8:31
great because i can eat healthy in a pinch it saves me trips to the grocery store when i don't want to cook and also
8:37
when i am really hungry and don't want to order delivery i can just heat up a factory meal and it's ready in minutes
8:42
you're really good i'm a simple guy one of my favorite meals is the spicy blackened salmon it's
8:48
got like smoked cauliflower with a little cheese factor also offers a variety of meals
8:54
that meet different dietary needs as well from keto calorie smart chef's choice and vegan vegetarian options as
9:01
well there's no prep and no mess the meals come pre-packaged and they're ready to eat in as quickly as two
9:06
minutes head on over to go.factor75.com jarvis130 and use code
9:12
jarvis 130 to get 130 off across six boxes that's go.factor75.com
9:19
jarvis130. thanks again to factor for sponsoring this video now back to the gram you can see how i'm torn here
9:26
because again i also don't like the direction that instagram is heading but the the
9:31
messengers here don't have the best track record unfortunately i don't know anything about this tati bruning person but the
9:39
change.org petition speaks for itself stop trying to be tick-tock we have tick-tock for a reason and let's face it
9:46
the only reels uploaded or recycled tick-tocks and content that the world has already seen what's innovative and
9:51
unique about old stale content nothing that is a good point it is true that the majority of these posts are reposts from
9:58
tiktok and instagram knows this but instagram wants your attention instagram wants to give you a little tick-tock
10:06
it's like tick-tock at home it's like oh i want to go over to tik-tok and instagram's like no we have tic-tac-toe the fact that you don't have to go out
10:12
to another app you would be surprised how effective that is so even if it is
10:18
tick-tock the fact that tick-tock now lives inside of instagram benefits instagram very similarly to how
10:24
when you know snapchat stories were just on snapchat and then instagram started using them or instagram basically stole
10:30
that feature it ate directly into snapchat's user base now tick tock i
10:36
think is too big to fail and i don't think that instagram is gonna kill tik tok or anything like that but i do
10:41
understand why they're doing this and it's because they want you to be on the app for as long as possible and see as
10:47
many ads as possible an algorithm that favors photos let's go back to our roots
10:52
with instagram it's ridiculous to talk about instagram in these terms this is not a social justice issue let's
10:58
go back to our roots with instagram and remember the intention behind instagram was to share photos for pete's sake we
11:04
didn't have video on the app until the developers were scared of vine rip vine by the way we missed that too so this
11:09
person does have a point but this is how these businesses work there is nothing sacred about the roots of instagram
11:16
instagram was a location sharing check-in app before it was a photo sharing app and they leaned into photos
11:23
because they thought that was a better that had a better chance of getting their business off the ground and so when they see something like tick tock
11:30
out in the wild they continue to want to make share prices and revenues go up so
11:36
they will in a second abandon everything that made them
11:41
to continue expanding and growing nintendo the video
11:46
game company used to make playing cards in the 1800s it's just how it goes they
11:52
they have no loyalty to you they have only loyalty to the moolah and that's on capitalism a platform that listens to
11:59
creators it feels wrong to switch the algorithm on creators that have made a living and contributed to the community
12:04
forcing them to change their entire content direction and lifestyle to serve a new algorithm listen to the community take our thoughts and requests into
12:10
consideration this is a huge point and i don't even have a um
12:15
joke for this this is just like super valid so i talked to a number of my
12:20
content creator friends from you know photographers making photos on instagram
12:27
and just like uh various content creators and no one likes the the shifts because an
12:33
ever shifting algorithm makes it harder for us as creators to reach our audience
12:38
because what my photographer friends are telling me is that now if they don't fit into the reels box if
12:46
if even if they are an incredible photographer like uh shout out to my my
12:51
friend linus if you're a photographer and you want to take beautiful photos then you now have to you got to get with
12:57
the program sorry this used to be the photo app but now it's mostly the reels app i wanted to see how
13:05
big the problem was so i cut out a pen and paper and i did little tally marks
13:11
on my feed for when i would get a regular post when i would get a reel
13:16
when i would get an ad and when i would get a suggested post which by the way is always a real the results
13:23
may shock you out of you know 100 of the posts on my feed 50 were reels if you
13:30
think about what it meant to post a photo on instagram before the the reasoning there are now half as many
13:37
eyeballs seeing photos because 50 of the slots on the feed are are reals and i
13:44
don't know what they were before reels i didn't plan to make this video but i didn't
13:49
know reels was happening but that's half the space for photos than let's say the
13:55
uh the beginnings of instagram of the reels that were in the feed 80 of them
14:00
were suggested and this is obviously this is just your mileage may vary this is my stuff and i think for whatever
14:06
reason i don't get as many ads as some of my friends do so i also have been hearing that there's a lot more ads and
14:12
shopping stuff 80 of the reels on my feed weren't even reels from my friends because my friends are busy
14:18
living their lives and posting photos specifically people who are leaning into reels or the people who are now who are
14:25
now eating it's the it's the wild west you can grow a ton by just posting a lot of reels on instagram because there's
14:30
now a ton of people being forced to look at reels in their feed which is a decision i'm not saying if it's a good
14:37
or bad decision but it's a decision that directly impacts creators dramatically
14:42
and instagram is making this change very flippantly i would feel pretty emotional if youtube
14:49
started to prioritize shorts over all other content because i don't really produce shorts like that you know it's
14:55
like i've made shorts before but primarily what i do is long-form videos so it's understandable that if
15:02
suddenly my outlet for long-form video was cut in half if i was getting half
15:08
the impressions because they were sliding in reels for regular videos
15:14
there would be a problem there to all the creators i talked to there is a problem currently on instagram with how
15:20
they've handled this shift if you're linus sorry linus i'm i'm picking on you
15:25
you don't want to cram a bunch of crap into a reel to get someone to see your
15:31
photos you know what i mean like like what are you supposed to do if you're a photographer and now the platform is
15:37
shifting away from from photography you have to adapt because there's no other there's no
15:43
other option also i totally understand why that would piss people off you know what i mean because it's just like you
15:49
know things can change overnight and they've changed overnight before on all over
15:54
like all across the internet all across all these platforms the world needs photography you shouldn't have to do
15:59
some cringy reel for your art to be seen that is a sentiment that is very common amongst photographers i've heard so
16:05
instagram responded uh instagram saw all of the likes on the post they saw
16:11
how many signatures the change.org petition was getting they saw that they uh you know it was kind of like a
16:17
reference to make america great again they loved that and they were like oh we gotta we gotta get in there we gotta
16:23
tell everybody we're not gonna change instagram we're gonna do just photos now just kidding obviously they
16:29
went in to explain why you're wrong mode to the users companies spend a lot of
16:35
time thinking about the direction that they're gonna go and they do a bunch of experimentation and then they go in that direction and i'm sure instagram
16:42
anticipated all the backlash that they're receiving and so now they're wheeling out their ceo adam missori to
16:51
try and explain away uh the problem to go oh no you know this is better for
16:57
everyone everyone wants this when in reality you know that it's just about the it's all about the money there's a
17:03
lot going on on instagram right now we're experimenting with a number of different changes to the app and so we're hearing a lot of concerns from all
17:09
of you so i wanted to take a few moments and clarify a few things okay so he posted this immediately after the kim
17:15
kardashian kylie jenner situation so this is maximum damage control he says hi there's a lot happening on
17:22
instagram right now i wanted to address a few things we're working on to make instagram a better experience please let me know what you think one is if you're
17:29
seeing a new full screen version of a feed or you're hearing about it know that that is a test instagram is
17:35
constantly experimenting with different changes to their feed as are all social media websites they basically experiment
17:42
they find out if the experiment was a success based on the metrics that they chose are people staying on the website
17:48
longer are they using it more whatever and then based on that they bring that to product people and they make a
17:54
decision a lot of times people see experiments that are ultimately for
17:59
helping the company get a better understanding of like what would happen if they did make a big change and they they flip out because that's happened
18:06
with youtube a number of times and youtube hasn't done a good job of communicating and in the past when they're running experiments because
18:13
trust me every one of these websites is running hundreds and hundreds of experiments all the time the issue is that not everybody knows that they're in
18:20
an experiment and there is you know talk to be had about the ethics of uh
18:25
experimenting on people without them knowing it but when you open up your instagram app
18:30
and suddenly your feed is like a tick tock feed except for you know where you see like one post at a time and maybe
18:37
it's a photo sometimes and maybe it's a real the other half of the time you go oh this app is literally becoming
18:44
tick-tock and then it blows up because now you've got a video going viral of
18:49
this change that no one likes and uh that happened with instagram and so i think that contributed to a lot of the
18:56
the backlash that they received it's a test to a few percentage of people out there and the idea is that a more full
19:02
screen experience not only for videos but for photos might be a more fun engaging experience but i also want to
19:08
be clear it's not yet good and we're going to have to get it to a good place if we're going to ship it to the rest of
19:13
the instagram community so that makes it seem like it's a direction that they want to move in
19:19
uh rather than something that they might do they might not do the second thing i'm
19:24
hearing a lot of concerns about right now are photos and how we're shifting to video now i want to be clear we're going
19:30
to continue to support photos it's part of our heritage i love photos i know a lot of you out there love photos too
19:36
technically you will continue to be able to upload photos on instagram whether or not people see those photos is a
19:41
completely different question that said i need to be honest i do believe that more and more of instagram is going to
19:46
become video over time we see this even if we change nothing we see this even if you just look at chronological feed if
19:52
you look at what people share on instagram that's shifting more and more to videos over time i would love to see the metrics on this but you could make
19:59
this argument even if more people were just posting videos because they were reposting things that they saw so i
20:05
guess i'm going to take him at his word but it's kind of easy to fudge to fudge what he's saying just because
20:10
as we consume more video 10 20 years ago we didn't have the bandwidth to be watching video all the
20:17
time and now as more and more people have access to better cell service better internet they
20:24
it's not a big deal to watch a video you're not like oh no my data which used to be a concern 15 seconds of video it's
20:31
the right balance between not too short that constrains your creativity and not
20:36
too long where you end up having to wait a lot of time for something to download and so of course naturally the the trend
20:44
of consuming video is going to be higher because we as a society like to consume
20:49
consume video does that mean that instagram needs to become a video app not my decision to make but i just want
20:55
to kind of point out that a lot of this stuff is pr approved messaging to make people okay with what you're already
21:01
planning to do if you look at what people like and consume and view on instagram that's also shifting more and more to video over time even when we
21:08
stop changing anything so we're gonna have to lean into that shift while continuing to support photos what they
21:15
leave out here is when you make 50 of the feed video you're kind of putting
21:20
your thumb on the scale right one other thing that is completely left out of this is that if more people watch video
21:26
on instagram more people will be on instagram for longer because it takes a lot longer to watch a video than it does
21:32
to look at a photo so instead of people scroll scroll scroll until they run out of photos from their friends
21:38
what if we put a bunch of distractions in there that are things that you didn't ask for
21:45
that is just content meant to grab your attention and that will technically make the engagement numbers go up i'm bad at
21:52
managing my time i'll get caught into a you know a whole of watching tick tocks or reels or whatever does that mean it's
21:59
good for me does that mean it's good for the app does that mean that it's a thing that you should do yes if your goal is
22:05
to make money which is why they're doing it the third thing i want to talk about is recommendations recommendations are
22:11
posts in your feed from accounts that you do not follow the idea is to help you discover new and interesting things
22:17
on instagram that you may not know even exist the idea is to help you discover new and interesting things on instagram
22:23
that you may not even know exist is also code for is a way for us to get you to stay on instagram longer because your
22:30
friends in real life don't post enough content to keep you on instagram but more charitably i am the beneficiary of
22:38
youtube recommendations half of the people watching this video are not subscribed to me it just showed up in
22:44
their feed and they thought oh i agree with that sentiment or i want to see what this is about and you click on
22:49
it and then you watch the videos so the difference is no one was going to youtube to see the
22:55
post from their friends or no one was going to youtube to see photos and when instagram basically implements a tick
23:01
tock slash youtube type thing it's going to ruffle the feathers of people who are coming to instagram for a completely
23:06
different reason and all of this is in effort to just grow instagram
23:12
into a bigger and bigger platform especially when facebook is not growing in the public zeitgeist now if you're
23:17
seeing things in your feed that are recommendations that you're not interested in that means that we're doing a bad job ranking and we need to
23:23
improve and you can x out a recommendation you can even snooze all recommendations for up to a month or go
23:28
to your following feed the translation of this is we're not going to change the
23:34
algorithm feed the suggestions are gonna stay um our ranking is going to improve which
23:40
ranking only exists in a um algorithmically generated feed because they've gotta order things in the order
23:47
of like like order they think is going to be most interesting to you or keep you in most engaged but then he suggests
23:53
the alternative of going to your following feed which is to say if you don't like it you can go to a different
23:58
version of the feed but not the main version of the feed it reminds me of how youtube has de-prioritized subscribers
24:05
in the past few years you have the home feed that is the recommendation algorithmically generated feed and you
24:11
have to go somewhere else for subscribers and so it's like for the people who really only want the people
24:17
they're following will throw you a bone there's a special feed you can get to but you'll never be able to set it as your default these are just concessions
24:24
so that you don't complain as loudly about the changes that they're actually making which are prioritizing video
24:30
algorithmic feed suggested reels whatever which he's got to do his job he's got to give
24:36
the like pr approved spiel but it's very transparent if you've ever worked at one
24:42
of these companies or like can clearly see what they're trying to do but we're going to continue to try and get better
24:48
at recommendations because we think it's one of the most effective and important ways to help creators reach more people
24:53
the thing here though is that when they say creators they mean they mean creators of videos because if they were
25:01
listening to photo creators like photographers they would know how much this is this is
25:07
hurting them and you i have never i have not ever been recommended a suggested post
25:15
that was a photo at least in the past like since i was trying this out maybe that's a thing but 100 of my suggested
25:22
posts were reels so if you're a creator who does photos then then you're not getting recommended so i
25:29
don't think you know you can look at me with a straight face and say you want to do your best by creators you mean creators of a specific type i mean it's
25:36
their app can do whatever they want to do it's their app but i think you know call a spade a spade we want to do our
25:42
best by creators particularly small creators and we see recommendations as one of the best ways to help them reach
25:48
a new audience and grow their following so this is another situation where the thumb is being put on the scale because
25:53
they're recommending more things that will push you toward video and they're also trying to
26:00
grow more creators that are posting video so that there's just more video on the app more video than there would have
26:07
been organically if the app was less tailored to video so that's a way that they make an active choice in tailoring
26:13
the app it's a video so i don't know why they don't just come out and say that i mean it's a company
26:18
what are they ever honest but we're also gonna need to evolve because the world
26:24
is changing quickly and we're going to have to change along with it i'll give some credit like missouri posts a lot
26:30
like this um and it is very you should think of it as company approved talking points
26:38
that are framed as just like a person you know giving it to you straight they're not
26:44
um but it can be informative for like trying to see like what the priorities of the platform are looking at the
26:50
comments here randomly the worst person you know made a good point james charles
26:56
of all people the reason there's so much growth for videos because we're being forced to post video the performance of our photos just take more than 90 so
27:02
creators are switching to video not because they want to because we're being told it's the only chance to grow james charles i do not co-sign anything that
27:09
he has done in this particular instance he is making a good point we all want instagram to be more like instagram not
27:16
tick tock see that's the thing i just i don't think there are enough people that care
27:21
is my fear i don't think there are enough people that care about what instagram is like because the majority
27:27
of people the billions of people that use instagram are just casually using it on their break or like when they have a
27:34
few spare minutes and they're not thinking critically about the platform like we as creators are thinking critically about the platform and we can
27:41
leave but they think that they have enough people who will get with the program to completely shift their their business
27:47
model to be more more video focused so that sucks but i mean it kind of is the name of the
27:54
game when it comes to social media i've seen a lot of a company changing something major and then the company
28:01
just going through with it and then people forgetting about it so in conclusion i've kind of already said this but instagram they
28:08
want to make money for their shareholders it's the profit motive they want to make the app the most profitable
28:15
it possibly can be while ruffling as few feathers as possible clearly they will
28:20
ruffle feathers if they think that there's a bunch of money to be made and the tick tock thing is they see a huge
28:26
opportunity there and that's why they're going so hard towards it but the bottom line is that instagram has no allegiance
28:34
to its users despite the fact that i mean it's a it's a company you know what i mean if tomorrow instagram found out
28:41
that cooking videos and recipes were the ticket to more money on their app adam
28:47
missouri would go and convince us that cooking is is the future and there's
28:53
there's such a growth of cooking videos on the platform and we're always going to support the photo creators and the
28:59
reels creators but you know cooking is going to grow on instagram and there's a few features that we have that you can
29:05
see all the non-cooking content if you so choose but your main feed is going to be mostly cooking and there's nothing
29:11
you can do about it like that's what would happen if if that's what the the research
29:17
showed because there are new instagram users being born every day and
29:23
the more that they can hook on the app for longer the more valuable those people are to them so if you're a
29:28
fair weather user of the app who doesn't like the changes and then ultimately leaves you're not as valuable to them as
29:35
someone that they could get addicted to reels and follow a hundred different
29:40
reels creators and watch instagram like television you know it's just it's just how it is man that sounds so sad
29:48
it's just a company it's just an app guys it's a huge one it's a very huge and popular app i don't think it's dying
29:53
i don't think it's going anywhere i think it's probably more successful than ever and reels are so everywhere and they're getting so much engagement that
30:00
it seems like the reels experiment is working really well for them i do kind of think that it's here to stay i could
30:06
be wrong i don't really have a dog in this fight i don't use instagram that much but i would use it more if you follow me at jarvis always be plugging
30:12
you know as a creator myself i think about you know should i be posting more on tick tock should i be posting reels
30:18
those things would grow me and my brand i just haven't got around to it so when you see me doing it
30:24
it's because i want to keep being able to do [Music] this stuff full time and i've got to get
30:30
with the program and get with the platform and we are beholden to platforms a","Use code JARVIS130 to get $130 off across 6 Factor boxes at https://bit.ly/3wlR3qO

Fixing My Brain with Automated Therapy,"979,429","57,000",9/2/22,52:50,"0:00
now when we hear the word therapy, certain thoughts and ideas might come to mind.
0:07
a few months ago, i did something i doubt any therapist would recommend: i went onto
0:12
the app store and downloaded five different therapy programs that all promised, in one
0:17
way or another, to help me fix ~whatevers~ going on up here.
0:23
none of these apps involve direct communication with another human being. Instead, each uses some combination of journaling, pre-planned courses, and ai to create
0:34
a wellness plan specifically for me. I have been using each of these apps daily as they recommend since then.
0:44
before we get too into it- this video is absolutely not sponsored by any of the wellness apps or programs i mention here, though it is sponsored by curiositystream and nebula
0:55
why am i doing this? .... Great question. The connection between humans and computers is inherently interesting to me, especially
1:04
with something as seemingly complex and nuanced as therapy. While i engaged as fully as i could with each of the apps i downloaded, i cant deny that
1:14
i started this project with a good deal of skepticism about how artificially intelligent
1:20
and/or effective any of these things could be. Who doesnt love some good scathing app takedowns, huh?
1:26
but theres also the flipside of this, which is: i live in the united states of america,
1:33
am self-employed, and pay for my own insurance. I pay roughly 500 dollars a *month* for my own insurance.
1:42
and part of the reason that number is so high is- well, part of the reason is the systematic
1:47
and coordinated failure of our elected leaders to provide affordable healthcare, but a related part is that i go to traditional therapy with a real living other person and paying $500
1:58
a month is actually one of the cheaper methods of obtaining that therapy. If i found one of these apps that could even approximate the kind of work im doing in
2:08
that therapy, then, hey, thats less money i need to spend on health insurance and more money im able to spend on absurdly expensive video game merchandise.
2:17
[men will literally pay $500 for a replica kim kitsuragi jacket before going to therapy]
2:24
so- what are the apps? Well, weve got reflectly, a journal that utilizes artificial intelligence to
2:31
help you structure and reflect upon your daily thoughts and problems. Next up is youper, a self-care friend that will help you get through difficult
2:40
situations and emotional challenges using cognitive behavioral therapy coping skills. Third on the list is moodmission, which, true to the name, provides missions
2:50
or tasks for you to complete based on your current emotional state. Its also based in cognitive behavioral therapy, or cbt.
2:59
then theres bloom, the last cbt-based app that promises to help me learn new self-care practices to cultivate more joy, happiness, and positivity in [my] life.
3:09
finally, weve got unearthu, a multimedia experience about self-improvement, healing,
3:15
and transformation. Two of my apps, unearthu and moodmission cost money up front- 7 and 5 dollars, respectively.
3:23
however, two more apps, youper and bloom, are basically non-functional without the in-app
3:29
subscriptions. I was able to subscribe to bloom at a monthly rate of $14.99, while youpers only option
3:35
was a forty five dollar annual subscription. Neither of these really gave me any hint at what i was paying for, i should add.
3:44
i just opened the app and it was like money please. Reflectly never made me pay, but prompted me to get a premium subscription literally
3:52
every time i opened the app. Still! Even the priciest of these dont hold a candle to my insurance rate; so far, so good.
4:02
its not just me whos turning to apps for help demand for mental health assistance has been exploding over the past several years, because of... [gesture vaguely].
4:12
covid shattered the concept that traditional therapy had to be held in person basically
4:17
every therapist in the country shifted to remote video sessions, and many are planning to continue it in perpetuity.
4:24
and, in what i think is generally a good thing, theres less of a stigma about going to
4:29
therapy than there once was while it certainly still exists, most people understand that seeing a therapist doesnt mean youre a dangerous or broken person.
4:37
honestly, according to peoples bios on dating apps, going to therapy might be the
4:42
single most attractive thing you could do. But even as attitudes have changed and zoom-call therapy has made it somewhat more accessible,
4:50
theres a bigger problem. Finding a provider just sucks. A third of counties in the us have no record of a licensed psychologist.
4:59
speaking from personal experience, trying to pick between different potential providers is like trying to order off a restaurant menu and youve never tried... Food before.
5:09
and even if you find someone you like, good freakin luck. [men will literally call a dozen therapy offices to be told theyre not accepting
5:18
new patients instead of going to therapy. ] thats all before you get to the issue of how much attending therapy costs, which need
5:25
i remind you, is uhhhh criminal. Which leads us to... Apps!
5:31
lots of apps. Like a mighty flood, silicon valley rushes to solve and/or profit off the crises of our
5:37
modern day. If youve listened to five minutes of any podcast in the past three years, youve
5:43
probably heard advertisements for betterhelp, a service that matches people with real-life licensed therapists.
5:50
similar to betterhelp is talkspace, another app with actual people on the other end of the line. Both of these offer the ability to asynchronously talk to therapists through texting or audio
6:00
messages, as well as more traditional video call sessions. These, it should be pointed out, are not cheap either.
6:08
generally around $90 a week, although there are various sliding scale plans and insurance
6:14
can cover it, if you have insurance. Those are a can of worms outside the scope of this video- in fact, theyre in an entire
6:21
other video, exclusively available on nebula. More on that later. What im more interested in right now are the apps that are a step down in price and
6:31
a step up in automation. While licensed human therapists may not be able to match demand, there are enough virtual
6:38
providers for all of us. Theres no limit to the number of patients an automated therapist can see.
6:45
each of the apps i used, while very careful to disclaim that they were not a replacement for a therapist in a legal sense, did absolutely claim to achieve some of the same goals as
6:55
therapy. Structure your thoughts, get through challenges, improve yourself, cultivate joy.
7:02
did they succeed? Lets run it down.
7:10
reflectly, the first one id use every day, is basically a diary app with a smidge of
7:15
mood-tracking thrown in. It provides you with a sort of inspirational mad-libs, then a more open-ended section where
7:22
you report on how youre feeling at the moment. I am feeling... Pretty good... About work... And i am feeling happy about this!
7:33
(the structure of these never quite made sense to me. ) then you can jot a title and a few sentences down related to this feeling.
7:42
it also told me that after a week itd be able to show me a comprehensive graph of my moods over time, although after a week i tried to do this and reflectly informed me it was
7:51
a feature for premium members only. I get what the app is trying to do- prompt me to reflect on my moods, record them, and
7:59
then show them to me in a way clearer than i could see myself. Knowledge of thyself is power.
8:06
this... Didnt really work for me. And not only because it kept the mood tracker behind a paywall.
8:13
reflectlys rigid structure of emotional recording- i am feeling... Okay... About work... And i am feeling anxious about this- seemed to put up walls around what i actually
8:24
wanted to write down. How i was feeling at any given time rarely conformed to the options the app gave me.
8:30
i dont know how to express im feeling guilty for not working enough *and* for pushing
8:36
myself too hard simultaneously on this scale. So i didnt write that down.
8:41
i chose from the handful of moods it gave me, and then i twisted my journal entry to fit the very basic mood i had been forced to record.
8:49
when i look back at my reflections, i dont feel like im seeing a pattern- im seeing a version of me with all the dimensionality sucked out.
8:57
the description of reflectly also says that its the worlds first intelligent journal app, that it gives personalized motivation and affirmation- i genuinely have no idea
9:07
what this is talking about. I never experienced anything remotely personalized nor intelligent
9:14
unimportant to the reflectly experience and yet the worst thing about it is its inspirational quotes.
9:20
i have never seen a more google first result of inspirational quotes-ass list in my life.
9:26
once it gave me a winston churchill quote immediately followed by a margaret thatcher one.
9:31
i nearly threw my phone out the window. Hilariously, one of the premium features is unlimited inspirational quotes, which
9:39
is some of the most egregious self-help snake oil i saw on this little adventure.
9:44
next up is moodmission. Oh moodmission. Sometimes, in such a cynical world of commodified tech-based therapy, its refreshing to just
9:53
see a little app work poorly, but sincerely. Moodmission starts fairly aggressively- there is a more comprehensive entry survey on this
10:02
one than on every other app i used combined. All of it feels very distinctly evidence-based; i would guess this is an actual validated
10:11
intake questionnaire, which is more than i can say for the other apps i used. After making it through the intro, moodmission identified two possible negative feelings
10:20
for me: low, flat, or depressed, and anxious, nervous, or worried.
10:26
fair enough! I do often experience both of those. But after all the introductory stuff, the app reveals what it actually is: just some
10:34
tasks to do if you feel like it. Every day i would log in, say if i was feeling low, anxious, or neither of those, and then
10:42
it would give me a list of possible things to do. As i write this, the options are write three things i like about myself, do high knees,
10:52
learn how to knit, crochet, or sew, and/or repeat i care about myself and other people
10:58
five times in my head. I have no doubt that evidence shows each one of these options can alleviate anxiety and
11:07
depression. But also... Come on, man. Moodmission is like texting a friend about feeling down and the only thing the friend
11:15
ever responds with is have you tried going for a jog?. Moreover, because the whole idea of the app is gamifying these tasks, making unappealing
11:23
ideas like doing exercises into missions, - guess what?
11:28
i played it like a gamer! I minmaxd this shit! Learn to crochet? That is wayyyy harder than doing 30 seconds of buttkicks or a brief tree pose or something.
11:40
i am genuinely glad i tried moodmission, because its a reminder that a simple evidence basis
11:45
is not enough. I guess i do want an app to have a little personality, a little flair.
11:51
its cute, its not particularly predatory, but its not enough.
11:56
youper, on the other hand, is slick. This one i had high hopes for.
12:03
it starts with a similar intake questionnaire to moodmission, though significantly shorter, and after the questions it told me that, good news!
12:10
this app is going to lower my depression score. This made me briefly panic because im a gamer and always trying to get a high score,
12:18
but sure, well roll with it for now. I did have to pay before i could do anything else- and when i did pay, it pulled the extremely
12:26
strange move of emailing me a bill for 239 dollars before subtracting 195, so i only-
12:34
only- ended up paying 45. My advice would be, dont make me think i just spent 240 dollars on this unknown app.
12:43
anyway. After getting through all that, i actually like the interface of youper quite a bit.
12:49
its got a number of different activities to select from, and when you do, check this out!
12:55
an actual texting interface! This is what i was expecting, heres a robot to help me fix my brain.
13:00
and its... Kind of that. Using youper often feels like playing a video game, because not only are the app's responses
13:08
automated and programmed in, but your suggestions are as well. If you choose the activity id like to reframe depressed thoughts, youper will
13:16
tell you very good choice! I love that youre open to working on reframing depressed thoughts.
13:22
and then it gives you three choices of what to say- thanks youper, its important to me, or i need it.
13:29
if youre observant, you might notice something about these three responses, which is theyre exactly the same thing.
13:36
youper is easy to use, with very smooth-looking conversations, because youre frequently not choosing a response at all, just given the illusion of doing so.
13:45
the entire experience isnt this limited. Youper does push you to write about yourself and your emotions.
13:51
in the next bit of that conversation, youper asked about a recent time when i felt depressed, and my response was open-ended.
13:59
the catch here is that it doesnt respond specifically to what i wrote- it just gives advice on identifying which thoughts are most likely to be connected to feeling depressed,
14:09
and runs through a number of thinking traps, like repeatedly wondering about something bad happening, perfectionism, etc.
14:16
its not nothing! And occasionally i found being pushed to spell out exactly where anxiety or whatever was
14:23
coming from to be pretty useful in itself. But despite its best efforts at personification, youper doesnt even really feel like a chatbot,
14:31
just a scripted series of text messages. And after a few weeks, i kinda felt like the app ran out of stuff for me to do.
14:39
i would just repeat similar conversations about feeling low or setting a goal or whatever, and that would be it.
14:45
its graph shows that my depression and anxiety scores have gone down, which, nice i guess,
14:52
but i basically just feel like those reflect how i was feeling at the two specific times it gave me the survey and not in general.
14:58
ultimately, youper feels a bit incomplete for its level of polish, and thats because
15:04
it is, kind of. I had the weird experience of going to the apps website and seeing a completely different
15:10
description of the program than the one i used. Apparently if youre in texas or california, the app can also help manage medications,
15:18
and in texas you can fully communicate with real therapists via video calls- for a significantly
15:24
higher subscription, of course. This makes sense- the cbt-lite activities the bot offers would probably be a much better
15:31
accompaniment for in-person therapy sessions, rather than a totally self-guided curriculum.
15:37
but on my phone in north carolina, nothing implies that theres a part of youper that im missing out on- other than the vaguely empty experience of using the app itself.
15:50
fourth on my list is bloom, an app that i started with a dose of healthy skepticism.
15:55
it has the fewest opening questions, only asking what brought me to the app and how familiar i am with cbt.
16:02
it tells me that cbt is 50-75% effective for overcoming depression and anxiety after 5
16:08
to 15 modules, another reference to a depression number that rubs me the wrong way.
16:13
its also the most expensive of all the apps i tried- i had to fork over $15 for just
16:19
a month of it. And yet. In perhaps the biggest surprise of this whole project, i really like bloom.
16:28
the biggest thing that sets bloom apart from the other stuff i tried is the delivery method. Unlike the halfway-automated assistants of youper and reflectly, bloom just uses straight
16:39
up videos of real people talking. Its got two hosts, mike and shernita, who have each recorded all of the apps dozens
16:45
of sessions on things like calming your critical self-talk, work through job hunt stress, and dealing with constant worry.
16:52
there is a lot here. Some videos are just a minute or so long, daily exercises for things like embracing
16:59
emotions or calming anxiety. But the real meat is the extended cbt sessions, which are often 10 minutes or more.
17:08
the formula is pretty predictable. Introduce the topic: for instance, how all of us experience fear sometimes.
17:14
[fear is a universal experience. So many living things can feel some form of fear. ]
17:20
then, intermixed with the hosts monologue, theyll ask you to journal a couple times when did you recently experience fear?
17:27
what questions came to your mind when you were experiencing it?  And then the host will segue into a cbt exercise where you really soak in those feelings
17:35
for a little, before practicing redirecting your emotions in a more positive direction.
17:41
then the session ends with a sort of guided meditation on the topic, which basically reiterates the big points of the video.
17:47
[but by asking the right questions... You can transform your own experience. ]
17:54
heres what ill say: bloom is sincere to the point of corniness, and it absolutely
18:01
took a little while before i was able to get past the soft talking, soothing music, and gentle black sweaters.
18:07
i was embarrassed when my roommate walked in while i was doing a lesson. Also, i fully think that some of my fondness for the app is just because every day includes
18:16
a pretty long guided breathing exercise, and that alone makes me feel better, regardless of the context.
18:22
but i like shernita! I like mike! Although they never directly responded to anything i wrote in the diary sections, the
18:29
app did a good enough job of asking me about specific aspects of a topic that it still felt like i was participating.
18:36
there is some stuff going on behind the scenes as well, i think. After one of these longer cbt sessions, it asks you if you feel better, the same, or
18:45
worse than before, and theoretically chooses future topics based on that (though its
18:51
hard to know how much it really changes). What surprised me the most is just how often i answered that i am, in fact, feeling better
18:59
than before. Bloom asks for significantly more time than most of the other apps; probably around 15
19:07
minutes total per session. Comparatively, the other apps ive talked about were only 2 or 3 minutes per day.
19:13
but i think the real difference is that its able to communicate, to connect, on more levels because of its commitment to video.
19:21
text is great for speedily jotting down the superficialities of how im feeling, but the deliberate pacing, delivery, and body language of bloom allows it to speak to me
19:30
more meaningfully. Thats a lesson that the last app on my list, unearthu, attempts to automate.
19:39
like youper, unearthu has an automated assistant you can directly talk to- unlike youper, this
19:44
assistant is more than text. She has a full 3d body, her name is kare, and shes weird as hell.
19:52
[hi there! Im kare. Im here to guide you on your journey of self-discovery and self-expansion]
20:00
unearthu has many similarities to my other apps it offers spaces for personal reflection,
20:05
daily goals, breathing exercises but it differs in one pretty significant way.
20:11
unearthu is not strictly a wellness app. Its a sort of interactive art exhibit, a *game* if you will, created by kara stone.
20:22
but even though you can purchase unearthu on steam and itch. Io, even though it actually featured on my best games of 2021 list, i think its very appropriate to talk about
20:32
unearthu in context of everything else ive mentioned today. The game slash app cannot be played in one sitting.
20:39
like the other stuff on this list, unearthu is designed for daily use. As it says in its description, its a one week program designed to support you in
20:48
living your life on the highest plane of existence. And kare, the dancing, plant-skinned ai assistant, will be there for the whole ride.
20:58
she introduces new inspirations each day, strange stock-footage compilations made by the company that created her.
21:04
she leads discussions on things like optimization, self-acceptance, and equanimity.
21:10
she pushes you to complete your ever-increasing list of challenges, consisting of tasks like write a gratitude list or wake up for sunrise.
21:17
kare is a perfect role model for the kind of high-performance mental health im striving
21:23
for. She makes choices based on hard data for the best outcome. She is always operating at full potential.
21:30
she is only ever doing exactly what she should be doing. Total control.
21:36
[kare: i remember when i was so deep into hating myself. It was all-consuming.
21:41
from when i woke up, to when i went to bed, through my nightmares... I am sorry.
21:46
just a second. I am not sure what that was. ] the gamification of self-applied therapy has been around far longer than apps.
21:56
hannah zeavin details these early attempts in her recent book, the distance cure- a history of teletherapy.
22:02
an early example that stood out to me is dr. Charles slack, a psychologist who, in the late 1950s, managed to essentially attach a points system to a tape recorder.
22:12
slack rigged the recorder to respond to audio input with a series of tallied clicks.
22:17
you talk to the tape recorder, your number of clicks increases. Stop talking, and you stop earning clicks.
22:24
participants in slacks research would take the tape recorder, go into a closed room, and talk to the machine- the higher the number of clicks at the end of their time, the more
22:33
the participants were paid. While theoretically, people could have just said blah blah blah into the machine
22:39
until their time was up, most produced what sounded like one side of an interview,
22:44
and moreover, some reported that they felt *better* after talking to the machine.
22:49
sixty years post slacks tape recorder, apps like reflectly are doing basically the same thing: loosely incentivizing users to catalog their thoughts with no one on but
22:58
a machine on the other end. But even in the middle of the 20th century, scientists were thinking far beyond simple
23:05
automated diaries. Would it ever be possible to create a fully automated machine that could treat a patient
23:11
in the complicated field of psychology? This isnt far from *the* big question of early ai theorization- the turing test.
23:20
to pass the turing test, a computer would have to have a conversation with a human so convincing that the human didnt know it was talking to a computer at all.
23:29
from there, it feels like only a small step to create a computer that could not only converse with a human but therapeutically treat them.
23:37
of course, there was significant skepticism that a machine would ever be able to pass
23:42
the turing test. As zeavin writes in her book, one of the most interesting and bizarre objections came from
23:48
the eponymous alan turing himself. Turing wrote: i assume that the reader is familiar with the idea of extra-sensory
23:55
perception... The statistical evidence, at least for telepathy, is overwhelming!.
24:01
his objection was, essentially, that humans are at least a little bit psychic.
24:06
and since computers are not a little bit psychic, a human would be able to tell that they didnt
24:11
connect with esp to the computer, meaning that no ai could pass the test.
24:17
and turing seems fairly stymied by this! Perhaps, he suggests, they could put the competitors in a telepathy-proof room to account
24:26
for this difference in ability. But as it turns out, the requirements of a therapeutic machine were not extra-sensory
24:34
perception, nor even convincing conversation. In fact, computers didnt have to get smarter at all; people just had to find a therapy
24:42
that worked like a machine. In 1966, mit computer scientist joseph weizenbaum introduced the world to eliza, essentially
24:52
the first chatbot. Eliza was a computer program that could talk back.
24:58
users of the program could type thoughts about themselves and their life into the computer, and the computer would respond with further questions.
25:05
eliza is a landmark moment in human/computer communication which is ironic, because
25:11
its creator thought it would prove the exact opposite. Weizenbaum said, direct quote, that he thought his program would demonstrate that the
25:19
communication between man and machine was superficial. Oho, weizenbaum, you shouldnt have given it such a cute name then
25:28
the way eliza works, itself meant to be a sort of parody, is basically just to parrot what the user said back at them.
25:35
one of the earliest published conversations has this stimulating interaction: user: my boyfriend made me come here eliza: your boyfriend made you come here
25:44
user: he says im depressed much of the time. Eliza: i am sorry to hear you are depressed user: its true.
25:49
i am unhappy. Eliza: do you think coming here will help you not to be unhappy user: i need some help, that much seems certain.
25:56
eliza: what would it mean to you if you got some help what eliza is parodying is rogerian, or person-centered therapy, created by carl
26:03
rogers in the 40s. The approach basically takes the format of repeating what a client says back to them.
26:10
crucially, the therapist isnt directing the conversation or pushing their client towards any particular area.
26:16
the idea is that the client already has everything they need to help themselves, and might just
26:21
need some prompting to say it out loud. This style is both easy to lambast *and, * important for weizenbaum, relatively easy
26:30
to program. Since eliza is just repeating things back, it doesnt need to know what those things
26:35
are. The computer doesnt have a programmed understanding of depression, but it doesnt need one for
26:41
this style of therapy- the client just says my boyfriend says im depressed and eliza can respond: im sorry to hear you are depressed.
26:50
what weizenbaum didnt expect was that people really liked eliza.
26:55
part of it was probably that person-centered therapy is more effective than he wanted to admit, but another piece that couldnt be emulated by a human therapist was the anonymity
27:04
offered by writing to a computer. People liked talking to her, a nobody that they were still able to give the outline
27:12
of a personality. Eliza would be followed by other automated systems, including a much more complex therapeutic
27:18
program called shrink. But although shrink was in many ways more capable, people didnt enjoy using it nearly
27:25
as much as eliza. Shrink was too clinical, and on top of that, it was named after its job.
27:32
eliza, on the other hand, was just a lady that lived in the computer who would never
27:38
judge, never disagree, and never talk about herself. Eliza has been written about ad nauseum, a sort of required background for any theorizing
27:46
on ai, human/computer interaction, and/or automated therapy. But i cant think of any media thats interrogated the concept more thoroughly than
27:55
zachtronics 2019 visual novel, fittingly called... Eliza.
28:00
eliza, the game, tells the near-future story of a virtual-ish counseling program that is,
28:07
also, called eliza. I say virtual-ish because the program isnt given directly to clients through their phones
28:14
or computers, but filtered through a human intermediary referred to as a proxy.
28:19
so the use of the program looks like this: real people seeking counseling come to an
28:25
eliza center. They go into individual rooms with a human proxy, rooms that very much look like a typical
28:31
therapists office. The client can say whatever they want to the proxy, but the proxys job is only to read
28:36
exactly what the program tells them. For example, a man comes in for an appointment.
28:42
he says that everyone wants and expects things from him. He says being a father. What if i dont want this?
28:48
and then eliza, the computer, types out why do you think you might not want this, and so the proxy says why do you think you might not want this?
28:58
in the game, were playing as someone who works as a proxy, a woman named evelyn.
29:03
and while working at this job, she is simply a mouthpiece for eliza. But this isnt some behind the scenes, secret thing about the therapy.
29:12
the clients know theyre talking to a program through the interchangeable proxies. Theres no illusion about what theyre communicating with.
29:20
the idea of eliza as a business venture is that people are more comfortable talking to other people than directly to a computer, but a computer is more consistent, cheaper,
29:30
and able to scale far more quickly than however long it takes for people to become licensed
29:35
therapists. And the clients receive essentially the same thing they got from the original eliza back
29:41
in 66. The general suggestion of a person with none of the interiority or self-centeredness.
29:47
a good proxy, which evelyn is, will never offer anything except leading questions prompted
29:52
by the computer. Theyve got data to back this up! Things go better when the proxies follow the script.
29:59
efforts to generate these natural language programs, algorithmic therapies, and diagnostic
30:05
tools necessarily narrow the scope of what is treatable to what computer scientists and
30:11
psychiatrists seek to treat, what the computer can do in its moment, what it can read, and
30:17
what its programmer can code
30:23
the original eliza computer program was not built to use a person-centered framework because its developer believed it an effective treatment; it was developed that way because thats
30:33
what he was able to program the machine to do. Even the advanced, company-running version of eliza in the game cant understand
30:41
the concepts its clients talk to it about. It can merely run their issues against a list of medications and meditations that have been
30:48
shown successful in the past. And maybe its an unreasonable task to ask a computer program to actually understand
30:57
depression or anxiety or insecurity. I dont need to understand how a computer works in order to use one.
31:04
but what it does mean, as hannah zeavin wrote, is that efforts to automate therapy are confined
31:09
to a narrow set of approaches. What computer scientists and psychiatrists seek to treat, what the computer can do in
31:16
its moment, what it can read, and what its programmer can code. 60 years ago, weizenbaum used carl rogers reflective approach in his rudimentary chatbot.
31:26
today, almost every app on the market is using something else: cognitive behavioral therapy,
31:32
or cbt. Ill say up top that this isnt a takedown of cbt.
31:38
im not here to tell you its fake or unhelpful or you should be trying something else.
31:43
like ive already said, my favorite out of all the apps i tried is using a distinctly cbt-based approach.
31:49
but i do want to talk about it, with a requisite im not a psychologist, but i can quote from one:
31:56
the apa lists a few core principles of cognitive behavioral therapy. One, psychological problems are based, in part, on faulty or unhelpful ways of thinking.
32:07
two, these problems are also based, in part, on learned patterns of unhelpful behavior.
32:13
three, it is possible to learn better patterns of behavior, which can relieve the negative
32:18
symptoms of psychological problems and improve the subjects life. Theres a lot this approach has going in its favor.
32:26
cbt is *the* most researched form of psychotherapy. By sheer volume, its got the largest evidence base, and much of that evidence suggests that
32:34
it is genuinely helpful! Its an approach that, because it focuses specifically on symptom reduction, lends itself
32:41
well to randomized trials and statistical efficacy analyses. If you are looking to pull data from a treatment and most clinical research is looking to pull
32:50
data from a treatment cbt is pretty dang appealing. The quantifiability of symptom reduction isnt only appealing to researchers, though.

We all have those formative childhood experiences that stick with us, guiding us, shaping our
0:05
lives - and one of mine is 'Mall Wrecked', the penultimate episode of the second season
0:09
of Looney Tunes spin-off 'Taz-Mania' from 1992.
0:12
Cliché, I know.
0:13
But I so distinctly remember the dread of those endless street lights when the family's
0:18
car breaks down in the Mall's empty parking lot.
0:21
Truly the raw essence of helplessness, just begging for a 2016 vapourwave remix.
0:27
And I think about it often, car parks, emptiness, the desolation of modernity - recognising
0:35
these spaces that appear again and again on the periphery of lives and stories.
0:41
You could say they're… ""multi-story""!
0:45
the great thing about car park jokes is… they work on many levels!
0:50
But, bad puns aside, for now, that 1992 cartoon began the rubber band ball of noticing these
0:57
spaces.
0:58
Until I'm implored, NAY, required to ask the question: ""Car parks, what do they mean?
1:04
Do they mean things?!
1:05
Lets find out!""
1:06
When it comes to cultural perception, well the first thing we'll find is that they don't
1:10
mean anything good - with experiences ranging from 'dude, where's my car?'
1:15
to 'voted most likely to be the last place you ever see'.
1:18
But more than the site of personal misfortune, it's invoked as the ultimate symbol of apathetic
1:24
destruction in Joni Mitchell's 'Big Yellow Taxi': ""Paved paradise, put up a parking lot"".
1:31
Here, the car park becomes a demonstration of convenience over sustainability, our destructive
1:37
willingness to 'take up space'.
1:40
One moment it's like oh were we in lot C or D and next BAM… climate…
Climate Crisis
1:45
crisis.
1:47
Maybe I could be more specific here if my engagement with the end of the world went
1:51
beyond recycling my little diet coke cans.
1:54
But that's why the up-beat rhythm of Big Yellow Taxi makes it the anthem of the apocalypse.
1:59
Far from being ""at odds with the sombre lyrics"" as it's often positioned, it perfectly echoes
2:05
the complacency with which we take things for granted, strumming as Rome burns.
2:10
Even the song itself, so familiar now, is maybe underappreciated - fading into a kind
2:17
of cultural ambience, just as the car park forms a kind of ambient architecture.
2:22
An overlooked by-product of modern life, quietly taking over, destruction by-proxy.
2:30
The title of artist Guillaume Lachapelle's miniature diorama 'Starry Night' hints at
2:35
how these spaces have become as universal as the night sky - maybe even a replacement
2:40
of it, like a parasite replacing the tongue of its host.
2:44
And while it retains some of its namesake's beauty too, the infinite mirroring of its
2:49
lonely 3D printed scene suggests this beauty is one of convenience - like the spectacular
2:55
efficiency of a well-oiled machine, or when you're lost, lonely face is illuminated by
3:01
the familiar glow of a Wendy’s and you feel a bit better.
3:05
There's comfort in its recognisable uniformity, we've accepted it's place in our lives.
3:11
Even the fish and the tongue eating louse can live in some amount of lopsided harmony.
3:16
But Terence Sharpe writes of a more helpless condition in Lachapelle's exhibition text,
3:21
noting ""the alienation of homogenous spaces.
3:25
… You built this, you live in it, so be a subject to its throes.""
3:30
Which is what I will say now whenever I can't find the car.
3:33
Journalist Simon Parkin identifies a similar ""menace"" in the car park setting of Carl Barton's
3:38
surreal puzzle game ISLANDS: Non-Places - which is inevitably where we have to break out the emergency buzzword!
3:45
Look I'm allowed one per video ok that's the official allowance by video essay law!
liminal space
3:52
Liminal space is characterised by the same thing that causes my reluctance to say it
3:57
– oversaturation - but more like when you say a word too many times and it loses meaning
4:02
liminal space is that with places - places that are ubiquitous, but anonymous and interchangeable
4:10
so much so that their repetition begins to erode their connection to reality.
4:16
Anthropologist Marc Auge, who's book Non-Places inspired Burton's game, speaks of this as
4:22
a condition of super-modernity, ""… a solitude made all the more baffling by the fact that
4:27
it echoes millions of others.
4:29
… never before have individual histories been so explicitly affected by collective
4:33
history, but never before, either, have the reference points for collective identification
4:39
been so unstable"".
4:41
We see this in ISLAND's eerie, unpredictable environments, even the apartment buildings
4:46
that rise from the parking lot, which, Parkin continues, ""speaks to the jarring a-synchronicity
4:52
of modern life; the cloistered way in which we live in cities, so close, so apart.""
4:58
Just as the term 'liminal' has sprawled, car-park-like, across academia, the space it describes has
5:04
become increasingly extensive.
5:06
With the rise of rented accommodation and coworking spaces, much of inner city life
5:11
could be considered, in some way, liminal.
5:14
But unlike Lachapelle's dioramas, which Debra Thimmesch suggests, invokes ""the human impulse
5:20
to organize and standardize space, particularly communal space"", ‘ISLANDS' framework is
5:26
one of playful subversion.
5:28
Since these 'non-places' are not places, they don't follow the rules we'd expect of places
5:33
- and so become spaces of possibility.
5:37
Games journalist Joshua Wise considers these settings ""evocative of all those little moments
5:42
lurking at the periphery of our memories"".
5:44
As if something half remembered is, then, half something else.
5:49
Half fantasy, half dream, half mystery - allowing curiosity to be reinserted into the mundane,
5:56
an invitation to consider what we could be doing differently.
6:01
Because all good things either come to an end, or live long enough to become too much
6:06
of a good thing (aka a bad thing), and then come to an end… yeah I'm pretty sure that's
6:11
the phrase.
6:12
And car parks are as much an agent of entropy as they are accessibility - made so all may
6:17
visit the beautiful things, enjoy them, cherish them and, gradually, destroy them.
6:23
Like a worn-out record, or an overwatered cactus.
6:27
But Big Yellow Taxi seems to advocate for transience as the way things are.
6:32
Despite name-dropping the parking lot in the chorus, it names itself after the fleeting
6:36
taxi of the final verse.
6:38
It wryly comments on what has been lost, but doesn't try to cling on - making the car park
6:43
not only unnatural in its imposition, but also its supposed permanence.
6:48
Maybe mocking the idea that we can ever stay as long as we like.
6:52
Because that's another thing we tend to do, as well as not appreciating what we have,
6:56
it can be hard to let go of what we once had, however inevitable its passing - desperate
7:02
to hold on to our past as if it were the last parking space.
7:06
Like the obsession with youth, which we can even see here is this parking scene from Fried Green Tomatoes
7:12
Film audio: ""Uh, I was waiting for that space.""
7:14
""Face it lady we're younger and faster"".
7:17
Which is really a projection of middle-aged insecurity, the young don't think about being young,
7:23
'young' only really appears from the perspective of 'old', when something we had is gone,
7:30
and, as author Pamela Lu's satirically solemn comparison mocks, we awake to ""…columns
7:36
of numbered spaces… sidewalls of youthful freewheeling escape now consigned to their
7:41
individual resting spots.
7:43
Were we destined to stay parked like this forever, to commune indefinitely with a faceless
7:49
pitiless field?""
7:50
But a preoccupation with loss can mean we continue to lose sight of where we are now,
7:56
what we might have gained, and what we could make of it:
8:00
Film audio: ""What are you doing, are you crazy?!""
8:02
""Face it girls, I'm older and I have more insurance"".
8:06
It's this present-ness that Pamela Lu's fictional group of experimental musicians pursue in
8:11
their recordings of ambient parking lot noise in the novel…
8:15
Ambient Parking Lot, ""when we championed authentic experience and plunged headlong into the romance
8:20
of the overlooked space.""
8:22
Perhaps inspired by a similarly present-focused performance by The Flaming Lips in the late
8:26
90s, where 40 cassette tapes were played in unison on car stereos - of which, in true
8:32
transient fashion, no documentation exists so here's an artist rendition.
8:38
As Lu writes of the fictional Parkers, “these recordings were meant to be made, not heard”.
8:44
And now even the car parks time has come, as photographer Agnese Sanvito set out ""to
8:50
document them before they disappeared"", now under threat of demolition ""due to the increasing
8:55
land values"".
8:56
In fact when I went on my research-based car park tour of London - because I'm a cool person
9:00
who knows how to have a good time - I found that, as I approached the most famous car
9:04
park, lauded for its architecture by many a top 10 list, I was already too late, despite
9:10
the 3 star rating still visible on Google Maps.
9:14
Vast structures may seem immovable, unyielding, overwhelming, and eternal - like the endless
helplessness
9:22
sprawl of carpark spaces, or the endless covers of Big Yellow Taxi - a natural setting for
9:27
helplessness - so unlike the freedom and autonomy of a speeding vehicle.
9:32
The ""ecstatic velocities made possible by fossil fuel and combustion.""
9:36
Lu's Ambient Parkers write, ""It was tempting to lose ourselves inside its ambient roar,
9:43
blotting out everything aside from sound and speed and thrumming air.""
9:47
It's tempting to cling on to what we once had, and, if that fails, to give up, give
9:53
in to the deafening sounds of escapist propulsion, which depending on where we are in the metaphor,
9:59
falls somewhere on a spectrum between unsustainable and planet destroying.
10:03
But I think what makes the playfully jaunty rhythm of Big Yellow Taxi so astute is that,
10:08
while it could easily set the rhythm for our mindless waltz of the edge of the earth, it
10:13
also resounds with resilience - to persist, to adapt, to live in the throws of what's
10:20
been created - in the face of inevitable loss.
10:24
So while it does have 'well if it isn't the consequences of my own actions' energy, if
10:30
you try to etch out a silver lining, and don't I always, it's maybe also saying ""don't give up...
10:38
... ya dingus"".
10:39
But, putting my etching needle aside before a positive spin becomes its own kind of evasive
10:44
manoeuvrer, we can still acknowledge the pain of it, mourn our losses, regret the role we
10:51
played in them - so that we may awake in the present, as author Pamela Lu writes ""wide
10:57
eyed and clear-headed, to the sounds of our unspectacular existence"".","Parking lots are the ambient architecture of apathetic destruction, convenience over sustainability, our destructive willingness to 'take up space', but do they also offer space for redemption?

our world is dying. Or more accurately, it is being killed.
0:07
fish populations and marine ecosystems are collapsing rapidly as the consequences of
0:13
industrial activity, such as eutrophication, global warming, ocean acidification, and aggressive
0:20
overfishing wage scorched earth style warfare on marine life. Forty percent of the planets soil, so rich and life-giving, has been decimated and degraded
0:32
by industrial agriculture into lifeless dirt, 100 times faster than it can regenerate itself.
0:41
our avian, mammalian, reptilian, insect, and amphibian populations have dropped by more
0:46
than half since 1970, and a quarter of all species are at risk of extinction.
0:53
collapse has been upon us for a long, long time. The flooding in jakarta, in pakistan, in india, and elsewhere and the drying rivers around
1:03
the world are exemplary of that fact. We have known the cause, yet little has been done to solve the problem.
1:13
why? It is an undeniable fact that the primary responsibility for this collapse falls squarely
1:22
on capitalism. Our overreliance on fossil fuels, our unfettered and uncritical embrace of our sprawling industrial
1:31
supply chains, the disinformation campaigns surrounding the compounding issues that contribute
1:37
to collapse, and the lobbying efforts of fossil fuel corporations are all symptoms of this
1:43
economic system, built on the concept of private ownership of the means of production.
1:51
capitalism observes one constant, prime directive: growth.
1:57
historically, from enclosure to colonisation to the slave trade, the process of appropriation
2:04
has been what fuels growth. It is no different today, where capitalism continues to demand constant expansion, pulling
2:14
ever-increasing quantities of nature and human labour to fuel that expansion.
2:21
technological innovations have played a major role in the extraordinary acceleration of growth, because new technologies have enabled capital to expand and intensify the process
2:33
of appropriation. And we continue along this trajectory, with ever-increasing levels of industrial extraction,
2:40
production, and consumption for the sake of it, with no discernable endpoint.
2:46
this system runs on the destructive ideology of growthism.
Growthism
2:53
thinking of growth as a damaging ideology may seem strange at first. Plants grow.
3:00
animals grow. People grow. But while its true that growth is a natural part of life, it never goes on and on.
3:10
organisms grow up to a certain point and then maintain a healthy equilibrium.
3:16
growth for its own sake is cancer logicits deadly.
3:22
and yet that sick logic is exactly what the capitalist economy relies on. Theres no such thing as too much growth, too much money, too much stuff.
3:32
every economy, every sector, every industry is expected to keep growing their economy,
3:37
keep growing their gdp, no matter what, on an exponential curve. This isnt just caused by greed, as some people assume.
3:46
in fact, capitalism structurally incentivises negative human attributes like greed, feeding
3:52
into peoples flawed perception of human nature. There are structural imperatives to growth that capitalism maintains.
4:01
let me explain. Capitalists own capital. Duh.
4:06
whether its real estate, factories, machinery, intellectual property, financial assets, or
4:13
the money they use to make more money. But capital that is stagnant is capital that is losing its value.
4:21
so they look for things to invest in so that they can grow their capital. They seek out companies that have growing profits year after year, so that their capital
4:29
will grow year after year. If that growth slows down, they pull out and look elsewhere to invest.
4:36
companies that fail to grow will lose their investors and collapse, so companies do everything in their power to maintain growth so that they can maintain their investors, regardless
4:46
of how much havoc they wreak upon the world. After all, if you dont grow, you die.
4:52
and if any barriers prevent that growth, you do everything in your power to dismantle and
4:59
destroy them. Environmental protections are barriers, so capitalists lobby against them.
5:07
labour laws are barriers, so capitalists fight against unionisation.
5:13
protectionist policies are barriers, so capitalists get imperial powers to fight on their behalf.
5:19
the commons were a barrier, so they were enclosed. Indigenous populations were a barrier, so colonisers tried to wipe them out, and when
5:28
that became a barrier, they supplemented the labour force through the atlantic slave trade.
5:33
all of these acts of violence opened up new frontiers for appropriation and accumulation,
5:40
all in service of capitals growth imperative.
5:46
these days, we measure a countrys successful pursuit of capitals growth imperative through
5:51
gdp or gross domestic product, first developed by the american economist simon kuznets in
5:57
1934 after the great depression devastated the economy.
6:02
he developed an accounting system that would reveal the monetary value of all the goods and services produced in the economy in one metric.
6:11
but even kuznets was careful to emphasise the flaws in gdp, because it doesnt care
6:16
whether an economic activity is useful and sustainable or damaging and destructive.
6:22
gdp is coupled to energy and resource use, so as it continues to grow, more energy, resources,
6:29
and waste are churned out every year, devastating our world.
6:35
you can poison rivers and decimate ecosystems while the gdp goes up.
6:40
you can use child labour and abolish retirement to make the gdp go up. Gdp provides no indication of the costs associated with its rise, no indication of the pollution,
6:53
sickness, social despair, and death that fuel its rise and push us over the brink of safe
7:01
planetary boundaries. And it also provides no indication of the beneficial activities that arent tied to
7:08
monetary value. Self-sufficient communities arent nearly as profitable as communities that are reliant
7:14
on capitalists for everything. And yet, after the bretton woods conference in 1944, this flawed metric became enshrined
7:23
as the primary indicator of economic progress. When the oecd was established in 1960, its primary objective was to promote policies
7:33
designed to achieve the highest sustainable rate of economic growth, and they didnt
7:38
mean sustainable in the ecological sense. The goal was to keep growing, indefinitely.
7:44
and when growth began to slow down in the 70s and 80s, because high wages, strong labour
7:50
protections, and access to health and education made labour too expensive for capital to maintain
7:56
high rates of growth, those barriers had to be bulldozed, by the rise of neoliberalism.
8:04
this rise took place not just in the west, but all across the global south, where western
8:12
powers intervened in the newly independent countries that had been trying to recover from centuries of colonialism.
8:20
structural adjustment programmes forcibly liberalised the economies of former colonies, leaving them open for the exploitation of foreign capital, which takes far more resources
8:29
and money out of these countries than they put in. These countries are also often blamed for the bogeyman of overpopulation, the supposed
8:38
real cause of climate catastrophe. But the global population is on track to stabilise, and even potentially decline.
8:46
not to mention, we know what it takes to stabilise a population: reproductive freedom, education,
8:53
and access to proper womens and childrens healthcare. In every single historical example of population stability under capitalism, material use continues.
9:05
the real issue lies in consumption, not population. To blame the populations of countries in the global south for the consequences of growthism
9:14
and capitalism is to compound a gross injustice. As hurricanes batter our islands, heatwaves scorch our farms and our cities, and floods
9:26
and wildfires sweep through our countries, the damage being inflicted upon the global south has been truly apocalyptic in scope and extremely disproportionate to what we
9:36
have contributed to the planets current trajectory. We are all suffering as a result of the enforcement of capitalism and growthism on a global scale
9:44
and we all have a role to play in the transition away from the systems responsible and the
9:50
healing of the earth that will need to occur. But the blame does not fall on all of us equally.
9:55
especially not when the globe-spanning supply chains that feed into the high rates of consumption in the global north leave human and ecological casualties in its wake on a daily basis.
10:08
we know exactly what needs to be done in order to avoid near total environmental collapse:
10:14
we need to cut global emissions in half in less than a decade and reach net zero before 2050, massively scale down total energy consumption and transition to renewables, completely revamp
10:27
our urban and suburban infrastructure to eradicate car dependency, localise our supply chains
10:34
as much as possible, reestablish millions of square kilometres of marine and forest
10:40
ecosystems, completely overhaul industrial agriculture, and of course, end capitalism.
10:51
there is no green capitalism. There is no salvaging this planet under capitalism.
10:57
capitalism with renewable energy and electric cars is not a solution. Were not going to decouple growth in gdp from ecological annihilation.
11:06
if we treat renewable energy the same way we treat fossil fuels, to power continued growth in extraction and production capacities, because oh, is clean energy, we will
11:15
continue to expand, fill our landfills, wreck our soils, raze our forests and fisheries,
11:22
and decimate the biosphere.
11:27
cobalt, copper, neodymium, silver, indium, dysprosium and lithium are all critical ingredients
11:32
in renewable energy, and if we continue along the trajectory of growthism, we will require
11:38
an explosive increase in mining, which will not only exacerbate our consumption of already
11:43
limited rare earth metals, but will also drive ecological collapse and perpetuate inequality.
11:51
cobalt mining in the congo is keeping the people down to a state of slavery and lithium
11:56
production in the andes has deprived farmers of the water tables necessary to irrigate
12:02
their crops and poisoned nearby freshwater ecosystems.
12:07
following the ideology of growthism will only make these situations much worse, giving rise
12:13
to clean energy companies just as violent and destructive as their fossil fuel forebearers.
12:20
nuclear is no solution either, considering the time it takes to get new power plants up and running and the dangerous vulnerabilities that nuclear power plants have to extreme
12:29
weather conditions, a staple of our current and future climate. Dont get it twisted, we do need technology and improvements in technology in the fight
12:38
against ecological breakdown, but not when that technology serves to feed a growth-oriented
12:44
economy. We simply cannot keep growing our economies, i. E. Raising our gdp, i. E. Increasing our
12:51
energy demand, while trying to heal the planet, and capitalism cannot survive without constant,
12:56
exponential growth. It keeps us trapped on this death treadmill of growth with the threat of recession.
13:03
thats why, despite knowing exactly what needs to be done to avert total apocalyptic
13:10
catastrophe within our lifetimes, very little has been done. On the contrary, capitalists and politicians are relying on growth to somehow save us.
13:20
growth that will create innovations that will make growth green, or at the very least allow us to counteract our destruction with geo-engineering.
Geoengineering
13:29
our rulers would rather attempt to manipulate the atmosphere, block out the sun, and change
13:35
the chemistry of the oceans, than give up their pursuit of growth. Even if, and thats a big if, geo-engineering schemes could work, they wouldnt change
13:45
the fact that constant growth in material use cannot last forever. And geo-engineering schemes will not work.
13:53
one of the primary methods of geo-engineering proposed has been beccs, or bioenergy with
13:59
carbon capture and storage, featuring prominently in the ipccs 5th assessment report and
14:06
in many governments approaches to reducing emissions. The problem is that beccs alone will not work to solve the other issues were facing regarding
14:13
the planets crises, it faces the same issues with the damaging extraction and depletion
14:18
of rare earth minerals that renewables face, we dont know if beccs is actually capable
14:23
of sucking up 15 billion tons of co2 every year, and we dont know if we can even build
14:30
the 15,000 new facilities around the world that it would require to maybe possibly work
14:35
in time to make a difference. With so much at stake, its not a gamble we should be willing to make.
Dualism
14:43
yet its a gamble so many have been willing to make because it embodies the same arrogant logic that got us into this mess.
14:50
the hubristic mindset that treats our earth as a mere arrangement of materials that can
14:56
be conquered and manipulated to our whims. As something we are separate from and exist above.
15:03
its a manifestation of the ideology of dualism, which arose alongside the system
15:09
of capitalism and the ideology of growthism to conquer the planet.
15:14
were taught to think of ourselves, of humanity as separate from nature.
15:20
the philosophical lens of dualism, developed and used by the likes of francis bacon and
15:25
rene descartes, places humans as subjects with spirit and mind and agency, while nature
15:30
is an inert, mechanistic object for us to lord over and manipulate as we see fit.
15:37
for capitalism to succeed, it not only needed to strip us from the land, but also to strip
15:43
us of more holistic ways of seeing the world. Capitalism had to see the downfall of animism.
15:50
it had to render the earth as a mere stock of resources for the taking.
15:56
animistic ontologies see no fundamental divide between humans and the rest of the living
16:01
world. On the contrary, they recognise a deep interdependence with the land, the water, the flora, and the
16:08
fauna that constitute the earth, in some cases even regarding them as kin.
16:14
and when you view the non-human creatures and places in the world as your relatives,
16:20
it fundamentally changes how you behave. It prompts you to enter into a relationship of reciprocity, not domination.
16:29
animism has been disparaged as primitive, but the fields of biology, ecology, and psychology
16:37
have come around to recognise that all of us, from the microorganisms in our gut that
16:42
help us digest our food to the plants that heal our wounds to the trees that network over large distances underground, are all part of a planet that operates like a living
16:54
superorganism. Nature is not out there and apart from us; we are deeply intertwined within it.
17:02
the story of animism and dualism is worthy of its own video, but for now, i just want to highlight that the dualistic philosophy bears some responsibility for the hubris that
17:11
has led to our ecological crisis. (skit) this video is sponsored by gates notes, a
17:17
personal blog of bill gates. Because theres nothing more important than the artificially amplified opinions of a billionaire.
17:25
when i traveled through the global south, i kept wondering what is it that makes poor countries so... Poor.
17:32
what is the core problem with countries like the democratic republic of congo, niger or
17:37
haiti? It cant be a history of colonial and neocolonial exploitation.
17:42
the real issue is the lack of energy. In our foundation, we aim to create a world where every person has the opportunity to
17:50
live a healthy, productive lifeas wage labourers fully assimilated into capitalism
17:55
of course. All these countries need is reliable energy for their clinics, offices, factories, and
18:02
call centers to make them healthy and productive, following the same path of progress as the
18:07
west, and joining such powerhouses of health, prosperity, and productivity like qatar, kuwait
18:14
or singapore. While my background is in software, not climate science, that shouldnt matter.
18:20
again, im rich. I'm now super-focused working on global health, development, and u. S. Education.
18:27
and i'm always trying to learn more. I know what youre thinking. Well, bill, isnt your carbon footprint absurdly high?
18:35
true! But i am taking steps to reduce it. In 2019, i divested all of my direct holdings in oil and gas companies - and i hadnt
18:43
had money in coal companies in several years. In 2020, i started buying sustainable jet fuel for my private jet, and in 2021, i fully
18:52
offset my familys aviation emissions. I'm not aware of anyone else who's investing more in direct air capture of co2.
19:00
see, its okay to emit it, as long as i offset it later on.
19:05
i know. The meaning. Of sacrifice. Look at how much ive sacrificed.
19:12
sorry, that wasnt very productive of me.
19:19
we dont need degrowth. We just need a greener capitalism. Its not realistic to strive for real social change.
19:26
just make green stuff cheaper. Gatesnotes, keeping you healthy and productive.
19:31
a proud sponsor of andrewism. [accelerated] while the segment was a parody, the main points are taken from gatess book
19:39
almost verbatim. We wish we were joking. [/accelerated] (end of skit) we need to recognise that we do not need the ideology of growthism to flourish as a species.
19:46
we do not need capitalism to improve the welfare and life expectancy of people across the planet.
19:53
in fact, the long rise of capitalism caused immeasurable suffering and deprivation.
19:59
capitalist propaganda extols the prosperity it has allegedly brought to humanity, yet
20:05
for the vast majority of the history of capitalism, economic growth didnt improve welfare,
20:10
it worsened it. Enclosure, colonisation, and slavery, the foundation of accumulation that fuelled capitalisms
20:18
rise, all spread human suffering and created artificial scarcity, which capitalism continues
20:24
to depend on in order to push desperate people into the labour market to be exploited so
20:30
that their basic needs could be met. The real source of the recent rise in human welfare came from improvements in sanitation,
20:38
healthcare, education, vaccinations, and safer living conditions, all improvements which
20:43
do not require capitalism. You dont need a high gdp per capita to achieve high levels of human welfare, you
20:51
just need to establish institutions that prioritise meeting peoples needs.
20:56
the default assumption that growthism promotes is that growth is good for everyone, but in
21:02
reality, the vast, vast, vast majority of economic growth only benefits the rich.
21:09
over the past 40 years, 28% of all new income from global gdp growth has gone to the richest
21:15
1%. And thats just income. Half the global wealth is in the hands of the 1%. Its time to shift our perspective from that of capital to that of life.
21:25
from the welfare of capitalism to the welfare of the living world. To recognise that what weve come to consider growth is primarily a process of our eventual
21:36
destruction. We need to move away from the ideology of growthism. We need to dismantle the system of capitalism.
21:45
we need to shift our priorities. We need degrowtha planned, collectively organised restructuring of the economy and
reject growthism
21:54
downscaling of energy and resource use to transition the economy back into balance with
21:59
the living world in a safe, just, and equitable way. The term degrowth has gotten some flack due to its potentially negative connotations of
22:08
poverty and deprivation, similarly to how the term anti-work has been received as a
22:13
dismissal of any form of labour. The english term degrowth arose out of the first international degrowth conference in
22:21
paris in 2008. In french, they use the term la decroissance and in italian, la decrescita to refer to
22:29
a river going back to its normal flow after a disastrous flood. While i believe it is important to present ideas in a way that challenges dominant cultural
22:38
norms and its best to use the established terms when introducing the ideas in this context,
22:44
hence why i use the terms anti-work and degrowth, in both cases, i care very little about the
22:50
label and far more about the substance, so i would gladly advocate for a post-work, post-growth
22:57
library economy. The aim is to build a new economic system.
23:03
an economy that is under the direct control of all involved in it. An economy that is organised around human flourishing instead of around endless capital
23:11
accumulation. An economy that is distinctly ecological and distinctly human.
23:17
rather than operating within an economic system geared toward creating constant need and filling that need by producing for profit, we can shift toward an economic system geared toward
23:27
meeting needs by producing for use, which will drastically scale down on total energy
23:34
use. However, there is a necessary caveat to this objective.
23:39
there are many parts of the world that live far, far below planetary boundaries and do actually need to increase their energy use in order to meet human needs.
23:48
i believe movements in the imperial core must work in solidarity with movements in these places to give reparations in the form of resources and labour where requested to support
23:59
the people in these places as they work to meet their needs and develop a better path to a healthier, more caring economy and ecology.
24:08
the colonised people of this world do not need to follow the same destructive roadmap as the places we consider developed in order to flourish.
24:16
to quote the martiniquan intellectual frantz fanon: we must find something different.
24:23
we today can do everything, so long as we do not imitate europe, so long as we are not obsessed by the desire to catch up with europe.
24:30
[... ] so, comrades, let us not pay tribute to europe by creating states, institutions
24:36
and societies which draw their inspiration from her. Humanity is waiting for something [other than] such an imitation.
24:44
the onus is primarily on the global north and other countries that have exceeded planetary boundaries to scale down energy consumption.
24:50
but how do we build it? How to degrow? Think about all the energy it takes to extract, produce, and transport everything in this
how to degrow?
24:59
world. Think about all the inputs and outputs that run this global capitalist economy. Its quite the energy-sucking behemoth, and it has been organised around one purpose:
25:10
fuelling economic growth. We need to take on this behemoth and change how it works fundamentally.
25:16
to slow it down and bring it in line with the limits of the biosphere.
25:23
it sounds difficult, because it will be, but a few relatively simple guiding steps will
25:28
put us on the right track. Heres a small part of what it will take to establish a post-work, post-growth library
25:35
economy: first, we need to put an end to planned obsolescence.
25:41
household appliances, computers, tools, furniture, and other products have been designed under capitalism to break down and require a new replacement after a relatively short period
25:50
of time in order to increase profits. Planned obsolescence actively stifles the innovations we need to make the things we
25:58
need last longer and prevents us from being able to repair instead of replace our stuff.
26:03
by putting an end to those deliberate manufacturing decisions and developing long-lasting, modular
26:09
products, we can greatly reduce our material and energy use worldwide. Next, we need to gut the advertising industry.
26:19
most advertising simply serves to generate social divisions, highlight class divisions,
26:24
and manipulate people into consuming stuff they dont need. Its constant psychological warfare.
26:31
its no secret that i hate it. Everywhere you walk, everywhere you scroll, everything you watch and listen to, its
26:38
all trying to sell you something. Its constant noise and its bad for us.
26:47
get rid of it. Shut it down. Thanks to the internet, we can search for information about the things we need without ads, and in fact, ads make the search experience much worse.
26:56
there are some beneficial ads, such as psas, but we really dont need most ads.
27:02
tear them down and watch consumerism perish.
27:09
another step we can take is to shift from ownership to usufruct. One of the three foundational concepts in my video on the library economy was the concept
27:18
of usufruct, which refers to the freedom of individuals or groups in a community to access
27:24
and use, but not destroy, common resources to supply their needs.
27:29
for example, rather than each individual in a community of a hundred people owning an electric drill, we can keep three or four electric drills in a tool library to effectively
27:40
serve everyones need for a drill when they need it. When we get rid of car-dependency, we can share the few electric vehicles we manufacture
27:48
to serve needs that cannot be filled by bikes or by our newly-transformed public transportation
27:53
systems. And so on and so forth. Watch my library economy video for more information.
27:59
another way to reduce energy and material use is to transform our agriculture systems.
28:05
the way we currently feed the world is unequal, inefficient, environmentally degrading, and energy wasting, especially when current patterns of consumption lead to up to 50% of all the
28:16
food thats produced in the world being wasted each year. We cannot keep treating farms like factories.
28:23
it is incoherent with the demands of the living world. We can either rapidly scale down to more localised permaculture- and regenerative-based agricultural
28:32
systems, supported by nearby communities through cropsharing and supplemented by urban gardens,
28:38
hydroponics, cultured meat, and aquacultures or we can continue as we going with the old
28:44
agriculture systems until we run out of fossil fuels, our soils are all dead, and the population
28:50
starts succumbing to the greatest famine the planet has ever seen. Its our choice.
28:56
i for one will be advocating for and trying to build food autonomy in my area as much
29:01
as possible and fighting for whatever it takes to cut down on waste so that we can rewild
29:07
more farmland and sequester more carbon to recover the earth. Lastly, we need to scale down or get rid of certain especially destructive industries.
29:18
agriculture was just one example, and even within agriculture there are certain particularly harmful offenders, such as the beef industry, which is responsible for the destruction of
29:28
the amazon rainforest. Getting rid of the beef industry alone would liberate over 28 million square kilometres
29:35
of land, almost the size of africa, and cut down on nearly 20% of annual emissions.
29:43
factory farming as a whole is very environmentally destructive. We need to cut down on meat consumption and ideally replace it with cultured alternatives
29:51
as much as possible. The pandemic has already shown us which industries are actually essential.
29:58
the fossil fuels industry, the arms industry, and the private jet industry, all need to
30:04
go. Obviously. The automobile industry and commercial airline industry have to slim down drastically.
30:13
we can reduce all of these industries and more, thereby reducing the flows of material goods, thereby reducing the stocks that support those flows like factories, warehouses, and
30:23
trucks, thereby reducing the amount of energy and infrastructure required to produce, maintain,
30:29
and operate all of it, all while directing our efforts and energy toward things that
30:34
actually improve human welfare. These steps to scale down total energy use should be taken by a broad range of affinity
30:42
groups and especifist organisations in mass movements, popular assemblies in communities,
30:48
and unions of all varieties, not waiting for the state but going beyond it.
30:54
some of these steps may be achieved by concessions won from the state, but let those concessions fuel us to go further still, not slip into the complacency of electoralism, until we
31:04
are in direct control of all the spheres of our lives. Workers cooperatives, councils, and unions can collaborate to transform, reduce, or eliminate
31:14
their respective industries, freeing more and more people of burdensome, unnecessary,
31:19
and bs jobs. Like i spoke about in my anti-work video, we need a quantitative and qualitative shift
31:26
in work. Quantitatively, we need to cut down on the amount of work being done, by a significant
31:33
margin, because most work today is simply useless, if not actively damaging, and unnecessarily
31:38
time-consuming. We dont need the 40 hour work week. Qualitatively, we need to take the activities we enjoy and need to do to promote human welfare
31:48
and self-organise them, through cooperatives and other groups, in ways that promote self-actualisation
31:54
and community. We dont need bosses. The whole concept of full employment, which is impossible to achieve under capitalism,
32:03
would be turned on its head. No one would necessarily be employed in the traditional sense, but through flexible
32:10
self-organisation everything that needs to get done gets done while people are free to
32:15
engage in caring, learning, socialising, exercising, crafting, building, creating, and everything
32:21
else. This kind of post-work, post-growth library economy can only function through the establishment
32:28
of an irreducible minimum, which is the guaranteed provision of the means necessary to sustain
32:34
life, the level of living that no one should ever fall below, regardless of the size of their individual contribution to the community.
32:42
this includes access to adequate food, water, shelter, clothing, education, healthcare,
32:47
internet, and transportation organised through the commons by affinity groups and popular
32:54
assemblies. The commons can only succeed through collective decision making power; we cannot outsource
33:00
this revolutionary transition to government agencies, corporations, or parties.
33:07
without a renewed access to the commons, a reversal of the enclosure of common wealth and creation of scarcity that allowed capitalism to rise to prominence, we cannot achieve a
33:17
post-growth economy. The abundance of the commons are an antidote to the growth imperative.
33:24
we can use community land trusts (clts), food and clothing banks, libraries of things, and
33:29
cohousing cooperatives to lay the foundation of those commons as our social revolution
33:35
is building its momentum. Its important to emphasise the social aspects of this revolution.
33:42
not only will we be liberating ourselves from the growth imperative in the economic sphere, but we will also be liberating ourselves from the ways that the growth imperative has shaped
33:51
our technologies, education, identities, institutions, and even our cultural norms and values.
33:59
our mindsets will need to shift, our relationships are going to evolve, and while such a necessarily
34:05
rapid transition may be disorienting for many, i believe it will be a worthwhile shift.
34:10
believe it or not, the earth can recover. Scientists have found that across ecosystems, it takes an average of only 66 years for a
34:20
forest to recover 90% of its old-growth biomass. Thats within many of our lifetimes.
34:27
in some cases, the transformation has even happened in less time. Rainforests in costa rica were able to regrow in as little as 21 years, pulling an extraordinary
34:38
amount of carbon out of the atmosphere. If we act quickly, we can see change sooner than we think.
34:47
through degrowth, we can open and expand spaces for healing, recovery, and repair.
Conclusion
34:53
so to summarise, my interpretation of degrowth or post-growth, is essentially an anti-capitalist
34:59
idea that challenges the dominant growth imperative and prompts a planned, collectively organised
35:05
restructuring of the economy and downscaling of energy and resource use to transition the
35:10
economy back into balance with the li","Capitalism is based on the cancerous logic of perpetual expansion, devastating the living world. In the face of ecological breakdown, we need to restore the balance. We need to end the artificial divide between society, economy, and nature. We need degrowth.
