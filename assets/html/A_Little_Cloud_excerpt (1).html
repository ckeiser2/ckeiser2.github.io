<h2><a name="chap08"></a>A LITTLE CLOUD</h2>

<p>
Little Chandler sat in the room off the hall, holding a child in his arms. To
save money they kept no servant but Annie&rsquo;s young sister Monica came for
an hour or so in the morning and an hour or so in the evening to help. But
Monica had gone home long ago. It was a quarter to nine. Little Chandler had
come home late for tea and, moreover, he had forgotten to bring Annie home the
parcel of coffee from Bewley&rsquo;s. Of course she was in a bad humour and
gave him short answers. She said she would do without any tea but when it came
near the time at which the shop at the corner closed she decided to go out
herself for a quarter of a pound of tea and two pounds of sugar. She put the
sleeping child deftly in his arms and said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here. Don&rsquo;t waken him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A little lamp with a white china shade stood upon the table and its light fell
over a photograph which was enclosed in a frame of crumpled horn. It was
Annie&rsquo;s photograph. Little Chandler looked at it, pausing at the thin
tight lips. She wore the pale blue summer blouse which he had brought her home
as a present one Saturday. It had cost him ten and elevenpence; but what an
agony of nervousness it had cost him! How he had suffered that day, waiting at
the shop door until the shop was empty, standing at the counter and trying to
appear at his ease while the girl piled ladies&rsquo; blouses before him,
paying at the desk and forgetting to take up the odd penny of his change, being
called back by the cashier, and finally, striving to hide his blushes as he
left the shop by examining the parcel to see if it was securely tied. When he
brought the blouse home Annie kissed him and said it was very pretty and
stylish; but when she heard the price she threw the blouse on the table and
said it was a regular swindle to charge ten and elevenpence for it. At first
she wanted to take it back but when she tried it on she was delighted with it,
especially with the make of the sleeves, and kissed him and said he was very
good to think of her.
</p>

<p>
Hm!...
</p>

<p>
He looked coldly into the eyes of the photograph and they answered coldly.
Certainly they were pretty and the face itself was pretty. But he found
something mean in it. Why was it so unconscious and ladylike? The composure of
the eyes irritated him. They repelled him and defied him: there was no passion
in them, no rapture. He thought of what Gallaher had said about rich Jewesses.
Those dark Oriental eyes, he thought, how full they are of passion, of
voluptuous longing!... Why had he married the eyes in the photograph?
</p>

<p>
He caught himself up at the question and glanced nervously round the room. He
found something mean in the pretty furniture which he had bought for his house
on the hire system. Annie had chosen it herself and it reminded him of her. It
too was prim and pretty. A dull resentment against his life awoke within him.
Could he not escape from his little house? Was it too late for him to try to
live bravely like Gallaher? Could he go to London? There was the furniture
still to be paid for. If he could only write a book and get it published, that
might open the way for him.
</p>

<p>
A volume of Byron&rsquo;s poems lay before him on the table. He opened it
cautiously with his left hand lest he should waken the child and began to read
the first poem in the book:
</p>

<p class="poem">
<i>Hushed are the winds and still the evening gloom,<br />
    Not e&rsquo;en a Zephyr wanders through the grove,<br />
Whilst I return to view my Margaret&rsquo;s tomb<br />
    And scatter flowers on the dust I love.</i>
</p>

<p>
He paused. He felt the rhythm of the verse about him in the room. How
melancholy it was! Could he, too, write like that, express the melancholy of
his soul in verse? There were so many things he wanted to describe: his
sensation of a few hours before on Grattan Bridge, for example. If he could get
back again into that mood....
</p>

<p>
The child awoke and began to cry. He turned from the page and tried to hush it:
but it would not be hushed. He began to rock it to and fro in his arms but its
wailing cry grew keener. He rocked it faster while his eyes began to read the
second stanza:
</p>

<p class="poem">
<i>Within this narrow cell reclines her clay,<br />
    That clay where once....</i>
</p>

<p>
It was useless. He couldn&rsquo;t read. He couldn&rsquo;t do anything. The
wailing of the child pierced the drum of his ear. It was useless, useless! He
was a prisoner for life. His arms trembled with anger and suddenly bending to
the child&rsquo;s face he shouted:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The child stopped for an instant, had a spasm of fright and began to scream. He
jumped up from his chair and walked hastily up and down the room with the child
in his arms. It began to sob piteously, losing its breath for four or five
seconds, and then bursting out anew. The thin walls of the room echoed the
sound. He tried to soothe it but it sobbed more convulsively. He looked at the
contracted and quivering face of the child and began to be alarmed. He counted
seven sobs without a break between them and caught the child to his breast in
fright. If it died!...
</p>

<p>
The door was burst open and a young woman ran in, panting.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is it? What is it?&rdquo; she cried.
</p>

<p>
The child, hearing its mother&rsquo;s voice, broke out into a paroxysm of
sobbing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, Annie ... it&rsquo;s nothing.... He began to
cry....&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She flung her parcels on the floor and snatched the child from him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What have you done to him?&rdquo; she cried, glaring into his face.
</p>

<p>
Little Chandler sustained for one moment the gaze of her eyes and his heart
closed together as he met the hatred in them. He began to stammer:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing.... He ... he began to cry.... I couldn&rsquo;t ... I
didn&rsquo;t do anything.... What?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Giving no heed to him she began to walk up and down the room, clasping the
child tightly in her arms and murmuring:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My little man! My little mannie! Was &rsquo;ou frightened, love?...
There now, love! There now!... Lambabaun! Mamma&rsquo;s little lamb of the
world!... There now!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Little Chandler felt his cheeks suffused with shame and he stood back out of
the lamplight. He listened while the paroxysm of the child&rsquo;s sobbing grew
less and less; and tears of remorse started to his eyes.
